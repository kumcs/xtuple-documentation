    <title>Topic: Submitting Reports and Jobs to the Batch Manager</title>

    <para id="Para979998">While the majority of OpenMFG reports and other jobs
    run quickly and easily, some require more time to generate. In some cases,
    it may make sense to submit these longer, more complex reports or jobs to
    the OpenMFG Batch Manager for processing. Submitting a job or report to
    the Batch Manager enables you to specify when the report or job should be
    run. For example, you can schedule the process to run during off-peak
    hours, when demand for server resources is lowest.</para>

    <note>
      <para id="Para980000">Some reports and jobs may place a heavy load on
      Server resources. Not only will these reports and jobs take extra time
      to generate, they may also slow down performance for other users
      attached to the same Server.</para>

      <para id="Para980010">This is a report with the potential to place a
      heavy load on Server resources. As you can see in the screen shot, the
      report is asking the Database to provide all records of Item Usage for
      Item Number COPY21 over the past three years. If this is a routinely
      used Item, the records indicating Item usage could be extensive.</para>

      <para id="Para980011">So, rather than run the report immediately by
      selecting the PRINT button, it might be wiser to schedule the report for
