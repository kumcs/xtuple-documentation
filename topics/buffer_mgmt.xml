    <title>Topic: Buffer Management Basics</title>

    <para id="Para554838">What is a buffer? In short, a buffer is a little
    extra of something that we maintain to ensure we can handle unexpected
    fluctuations. OpenMFG's Buffer Management system reports on three types of
    buffers: stock, time, and capacity. The following examples from daily life
    may help explain the three different kinds of buffers:</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>A stock buffer is like the extra coffee we keep in the
          cupboard to make certain we have enough should company drop in. For
          example, let's say we want to always keep at least three pounds of
          coffee on hand. Three pounds, then, is our buffer quantity. As long
          as we have this buffer, we"re confident we"ll have enough to serve
          unexpected guests. Whenever our supply drops below three pounds,
          we"ll put coffee on our shopping list and buy more. Just because the
          coffee falls below three pounds doesn"t mean we"re in a critical
          situation. However, if we fall significantly below that level, we
          need to act immediately.</para>

    <note>
      <para id="Para554842">The critical buffer status in the OpenMFG Buffer
      Management system is 66%. In other words, any time we consume 66% of a
      buffer, then it's time to act immediately to resolve the situation.
      Using the coffee example, if our supply drops to one pound (and our
      buffer quantity is three pounds), then we"ve used up two-thirds of our
      buffer--or 66%. With that much of our buffer consumed, we need to buy
      more coffee right away. The 66% value is a percentage that is widely
      used in academic research and practical real-world implementations of
      the Theory of Constraints--a theory pioneered by Eliyahu
      Goldratt.</para>

          <para>A time buffer is like the time we factor into a trip to the
          airport to catch a flight. Let\qs say we allow ourselves three hours
          to reach the airport, check bags, pass through security and proceed
          to the gate ready to board. That means our time buffer is three
          hours. If we get stuck in traffic for two hours, then we\qve used up
          66% of our buffer. This is now a critical situation requiring our
          full attention. We must act immediately to either get out of
          traffic, take an alternate route, or reschedule our flight.</para>

          <para>A capacity buffer is like the surface on your barbecue grill
          which can hold up to 12 hamburgers at one time. In this scenario,
          the grill's capacity buffer is 12. If each hamburger takes 15
          minutes to cook--and you can cook 12 at a time--then you can produce
          48 hamburgers in an hour. Now, let's say you"ve got 100 guests
          coming for dinner. If your plan is to feed everyone in one hour,
          you"ve got a capacity problem. You"ll either need to fire up an
          extra grill, or start cooking an hour early to build up your stock
          burger buffer ahead of time.</para>

      Quantity on Hand to 300. Finally, we will run Buffer Management to

        <title>Stock Buffer</title>

        <para id="Para554871">A stock buffer, as the name implies, is an
        accumulation of Items stored in Inventory that act as a hedge against
        demand where the required service time is shorter than a time buffer
        for that Item would allow. For example: If we have a standard part
        that takes two weeks to produce, but which we must be able to ship in
        one day, we would stock that Item to ensure the one-day service level.
        In another case, we may be able to produce the Item in a day, but
        sometimes seasonal load changes result in a production bottleneck
        where the backlog on a critical resource for that Item is greater than
        a day. The stock buffer allows us to continue shipping the Item under
        those circumstances. It is important to note that due dates are
        irrelevant for Orders with stock buffers. The buffer size is
        determined by the Reorder Level at the Item site.</para>

      <para id="Para554872">Okay, we are finished with the setup needed for
      our scenario. We are now ready to run the Buffer Management system--and

      <para id="Para554896">As you can see in <link endterm="Anchor11420"
      id="XRef554895" linkend="Anchor11420"> Inventory Buffer Status by Class

      in the "Status" column. If an Item has a buffer status of 66 or greater,
      it will display in red. The buffer status for Item TBODY1 = 70. To

      </itemizedlist>

      <para id="Para554899">This equation shows us that the stock buffer for
      this Item Site has been depleted by 700 units--or 70%. Keep in mind that
      this calculation also subtracts out allocated quantities, which in this

      <para id="Para554903">Next we will look at a time buffer scenario.
      Please note that time buffers are calculated only for make-to-order
      Items. In OpenMFG terms, a make-to-order Item is an Item whose Item Site
      record leaves the "Stocked at this Warehouse" flag UNCHECKED. Work
      Orders for make-to-order Items are generated automatically during Sales
      Order entry to meet demand.</para>

      <para id="Para554904">The Item Site Lead Time determines the initial
      buffer size for make-to-order Work Orders. That lead time should include
      a "Murphy" factor--that is, time for things that might go wrong. Orders
      with short Lead Times will increase in status faster than those with
      long Lead Times. This helps to ease the problem where operators
      concentrate just on Work Order start/finish dates, when the total amount
      of work involved (and corresponding time allotment) has a lot to do with
      what should be worked on first.</para>

      id="XRef554933" linkend="Anchor63001"> W/O Buffer Status by Class Code
      Display</link>Figure 2.26, the next-to last column "Buffer Type" shows
      that OpenMFG has calculated a "Time" buffer for our Work Order. The
      value of this time buffer is shown in the "Buffer Status" column.
      Because the buffer status for the Work Order = 0, there is no need to
      take immediate action. Remember, the magic number for the Buffer
      Management system is 66. As long as the buffer status of a Work Order is
      less than 66, then the system does not consider the Order to be in a
      critical state.</para>

        <para id="Para554939">A time buffer is the lead time, measured in
        working days, of a supply order for an Item that is not stocked. By
        working days we mean the days that the shop is available to work,
        which may exclude weekends or holidays. For example: If a shop
        typically has a three-week lead time, but does not work weekends, then
        the time buffer for that shop would typically be 15 working days. The
        OpenMFG Buffer Management system looks at the start and finish dates
        of a discrete Purchase Order or Work Order, removes non-working days
        for the Order\qs Warehouse, and then calculates the time
        buffer.</para>

      <para id="Para554956">Note that the Order's buffer status has now

      Order to the due date of the Order, the more the Order's time buffer is
      consumed. Keep in mind that your results will vary depending on the
      current day of the week. The Buffer Management system uses a Warehouse
      work week defined in the M/S Module's "Master Information" section. The
      Warehouse week functionality enables you to define the days of the week
      your plant is open. Closed days, such as weekends in the demo database,
      are factored into the Buffer Management time buffer calculation.</para>

      The start time of a Work Order is irrelevant. It is its completion on
      its due date which enables us to achieve a high degree of Customer
      satisfaction for on-time delivery. Buffer Management shows us the Orders
      for which we risk missing the delivery date because we have already used
      up 66% of their time buffer.</para>

      <para id="Para554966">Finally, let's examine a capacity buffer scenario.
      The Work Order we created in the previous section enabled us to get
      familiar with the concept of time buffers. Well, in addition to time
      factors, we must also consider the impact--or load--that a Work Order
      places on Work Centers. In the case of production for the YTRUCK1 Item,
      three Work Centers will be affected.</para>

      <para id="Para554967">Nearly all manufacturers have one bottleneck Work
      Center that constrains their entire operation. It is the load on this
      Work Center that warrants close monitoring. The capacity buffer screen
      enables us to view the current load in relation to a definable number of
      days of capacity. To view the capacity buffer status for our current
      Work Centers, follow these steps:</para>

      <para id="Para554979">The first two columns after the Work Center names
      show the current load on each Work Center Orders that pass through each,
      regardless of their scheduled dates. The fifth column shows the Daily
      Capacity of each Work Center, as defined in the Master Information for
      each Work Center's definition. The "Days Load" column shows the sum of
      Total Setup and Total Run (total load in minutes) divided by a Work
      Center's Daily Capacity. The final "Buffer Status" column takes into
      account the value you set in the "Max Days Load" field before you
      clicked the QUERY button.</para>

      <para id="Para554980">Here is another example to illustrate how the
      capacity buffer is calculated. Suppose that the Daily Capacity of the
      Stamping Work Center is 480 minutes, and we set the display with a Max
      Days Load = 5 days. The numerator in our calculation would be 5 * 480 =
      2400 minutes. If the Total Setup for all Work Orders going through
      Stamping is 60 minutes and the Total Run time is 2000 minutes, the
      numerator will be 2060 minutes. The buffer status would then be 2060 /
      2400, or 85%. This tells us that we have loaded the Stamping operation
      with 85% of the capacity available over a 5-day period of time. We would
      see the value "85" displayed in the "Buffer Status" column.</para>

      <note>
        <title>Capacity Buffer</title>

        <para id="Para554983">The capacity buffer is the relative load of a
        resource compared to the desired lead time of Items coming out of that
        resource. For example, suppose we have a shop with a typical lead time
        of two weeks that has a milling department heavily loaded. Perhaps we
        have identified milling as our shop's bottleneck and will use the
        Buffer Management system to monitor it. The capacity buffer would be
        two-weeks worth of load, meaning that the milling department can be
        loaded with up to two-weeks worth of work before it is considered
        fully-consumed. The capacity buffer size is entered as "Max Days Load"
        by the user when they run the Capacity Buffer Status report. When the
        Buffer column in the display for milling equals 100 we know it is
        fully consumed.</para>
      </note>

      <para id="Para554984">The capacity buffer is an excellent tool for
      monitoring your shop's bottleneck Work Center(s). Using the system, you
      can help ensure that the shop as a whole is able to achieve complete
      Work Orders, and, ultimately, deliver Orders successfully to your
      Customers within the stated lead times.</para>

      <title>Other Buffer Management Displays</title>

      <para id="Para554986">Keep in mind that you must run the Buffer
      Management utilities (i.e., "Run Buffer Status by Planner Code" and "Run
      Buffer Status by Item") for the information in the buffer status screens
      to be updated. Best practice would be to submit the job "Run Buffer
      Status by Planner Code" to the Batch Manager on a nightly basis,
      scheduling it to run each night after midnight. In this way, you will be
      able to monitor the updated buffer status results when you arrive in the
      morning--allowing you to then set appropriate priorities for the rest of
      the day.</para>

      <para id="Para554987">Also recall that time buffers are only calculated
      for make-to-order Items. The appropriate buffer for Items that are not
