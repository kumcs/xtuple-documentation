    </indexterm>Topic: Count Tag Basics</title>
  <para>Count Tags are used to spearhead Inventory counts. If you are involved
  with Inventory counting, then you need to understand how Count Tags work. In
  this section, we cover Count Tag basics&mdash;from creating, to entering, to
  posting Count Tags.</para>
  <note>
    <para>The difference between Count Tags and Cycle Count Tags relates to
    the manner in which each is created. Count Tags, which are the subject of
    this section, are created manually. Cycle Count Tags, on the other hand,
    are created as the result of a Cycle Count request. To learn more about
    Cycle Counting, see the section dedicated to that topic.</para>

    <para>For this exercise, let's imagine we want to count Item B1, which is
    located in Warehouse WEST. To begin, we need to create a Count Tag for
    this Item/Warehouse combination, as shown in the following screen:</para>

        <para>Mark Created Count Tag as Priority: Selected. Count Tags marked
        as having priority status are listed first in any prioritized lists.
        For example, priority Count Tags will appear at the top of the Count
        Tag Edit List; whereas, non-priority Count Tags will appear at the
        bottom of the list.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Freeze Inventory: Selected. We are specifying that Inventory be
        frozen while we are counting Item B1. Freezing Inventory during the
        Inventory counting process helps preserve the integrity of Quantity on
        Hand (QOH) values. For more information on freezing and thawing, see
        the section devoted to freezing and thawing.</para>

      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Once our parameters have been entered, we are ready to select the
    CREATE TAG button. Doing so will create our Count Tag. To verify the Count
    Tag has been created, we open the Count Tag Edit List. Sure enough, the
    Count Tag does appear on the list, as shown in the following
    screenshot:</para>

    <note>
      <para>Count Tag Numbers are generated automatically by the system in a
      sequential pattern, using specifications entered on the Warehouse
      master. Within the Warehouse master you can specify both the prefix to
      be used by Count Tags created in the given Warehouse (e.g., WEST) and
      also the starting point for the numeric sequence.</para>

    <para>Okay, let's assume we have now physically gone into Warehouse WEST
    and counted Item B1. Our count discovered 635 units on hand. We are now
    ready to open the Count Tag and enter our Inventory count total. To open
    the Count Tag, either double-click on it or highlight it and then select
    the EDIT button. The Count Tag entry screen opens up, as shown in the
    following screenshot:</para>
    <para><anchor id="Anchor21825" role="Cross-Ref"
    xreflabel="21825: Figure: Figure 4.3:  Enter Count Tag Details" />

          <caption>Enter Count Tag Details</caption>
        </mediaobject>
      </screenshot></para>
    <para>In the "Count Qty." field we enter 635. This is the Quantity on Hand
    (QOH) we discovered during our Inventory count. Interestingly, the system
    is showing a different QOH for Item B1 in Warehouse WEST. If you look
    closely at our example, you can see the system believes there are 640
    units on hand. Inventory discrepancies such as this can arise from a
    number of different causes&mdash;from undocumented Scrap transactions, to
    pilferage, etc. The important point is that by entering and posting a
    Count Tag with current physical Inventory information, you can update the
    system and revise QOH totals.</para>
    <note>
      <para>Count Tags may also be entered by selecting the "Enter Count Tag"
      option from the Physical Inventory submenu.</para>
    </note>
    <para>Continuing on, we go ahead and enter a comment to associate with the
    Count Tag. This comment, which is optional, may contain any information
    you want to associate with the Count Tag. We are now ready to select the
    SAVE button. As you can see in the following screenshot, the count total
    is now registered on the Count Tag Edit List:</para>

    <para>Looking at the example, you see that the QOH discrepancy has created
    a negative Inventory Asset variance. The Count Tag Edit List is a good
    starting point for identifying and tracking these discrepancies. Note that
    the list gives you the ability to highlight records when variances exceed
    either a monetary value or percentage you define. When a record is
    highlighted, it will be easy to locate because it will display in red
    type. Inventory Asset variances&mdash;if they exist&mdash;will also post to the
    General Ledger when Count Tags are posted, providing yet another starting
    point for investigating discrepancies.</para>
    <tip>
      <para>If you want to change the count quantity for a Count Tag prior to
      posting it, simply open the Count Tag for editing.</para>
    </tip>
    <para>Before we post this Count Tag, let's take a quick look at the I/M
    Module display Quantities on Hand by Item to verify the QOH total we"re
    seeing on the Count Tag Edit List. As expected, the following screen shows
    us a QOH of 640 for Item B1 in Warehouse WEST:</para>

    <para>We are now ready to post our Count Tag and update the system record.
    After highlighting our Count Tag on the Count Tag Edit List, we select the
    POST button. The following screen appears:</para>

    <note>
      <para>Count Tags can be posted in several ways. You can post them
      individually from the Count Tag Edit List. Or you can post them in
      batches, using the Post Count Tags utility found on the Physical
      Inventory submenu.</para>
    </note>
    <para>Looking at the Post Count Tag screen, we see our count total and the
    comment we associated with the Count Tag. If we need to include an
    additional comment&mdash;for whatever reason&mdash;we may do so at this point.
    Notice that the option "Thaw Inventory" is selected. If you recall, we
    elected to freeze Inventory at the time we created the Count Tag. Now that
    our count is complete, we want to be sure to thaw Inventory so QOH for the
    Item will be updated appropriately. For more information on freezing and
    thawing, see the section dedicated to that topic.</para>
    <para>The final step is to post the Count Tag. To do so, we select the
    POST COUNT button. Posting a Count Tag removes the Tag from the Count Tag
    Edit List. And, as you can see from the following screen shot, Quantity on
    Hand for the Item is also updated to reflect the Count Tag total:</para>

      </indexterm>Entering Count Slips</title>
    <para>We have seen how to post an Inventory count total using a Count Tag.
    Now let's repeat the same process, but add Count Slips into the mix. If
    Count Tags are the parents, then Count Slips are the children. Count Slips
    are used to contribute Inventory count totals to a Count Tag.</para>
    <para>To begin, we will create another Count Tag, using the same
    Item/Warehouse combination used in the previous example. The following
    screenshot of the Count Tag Edit List shows both the newly-created Count
    Tag and also the "Enter Count Slip" option selected from the right-click
    menu:</para>

    <para>As this next scenario will show, having the ability to contribute
    count subtotals from various sources can be extremely useful. Selecting
    the "Enter Count Slip" option brings up the Count Slip interface, as shown
    in the following screen:</para>

      <para>Unlike Count Tags, Count Slips do not have to be created before
      they can be entered.</para>
    </note>
    <para>As you can see in the example, the Enter Count Slip screen presents
    us with a range of information and options. For the purpose of this
    exercise, we will enter the following:</para>

    <para>So far, we have only counted one Location: RACK01. Item B1 is also
    stored in Location RACK02. Counting Inventory at that Location falls to
    another employee (i.e., Sandra). As before, the employee enters the
    required information on the Count Slip. However, when she attempts to save
    the Count Slip quantity to the Count Tag total, she encounters the
    following error message:</para>

    <para>As the message indicates, the system has been configured to disallow
    duplicate Count Slip Numbers. To correct the problem, the employee must
    return to the Enter Count Slip screen and enter a unique Count Slip
    Number.</para>
    <note>
      <para>By default, OpenMFG allows only one unposted Count Tag per Item
      Site. If an unposted Count Tag already exists for an Item Site, then an
      additional duplicate Count Tag may not be added.</para>

    <para>Just as Count Tags have their own edit list, Count Slips also have
    an edit list. To access the Count Slip Edit List, highlight a Count Tag
    record and open the right-click menu. The following screenshot shows the
    Count Slip Edit List:</para>

        </mediaobject>
      </screenshot></para>
    <para>From the Count Slip Edit List, you can edit, post, and delete Count
    Slips&mdash;or create new ones. As you can see, the list provides detailed
    information about each Count Slip record. For this exercise, we will be
    posting both of our Count Slips from this screen.</para>
    <para>To verify that the Count Slips are showing as posted on the Count
    Tag Edit List, we return to that screen. Sure enough, the Count Slips are
    showing as posted:</para>

          <caption>Count Tag Edit List with Posted Count
          Slips</caption>
        </mediaobject>
      </screenshot></para>
    <para>To review, then, we have used Count Slips to collect Inventory
    quantities from a variety of different Locations using different
    employees. As we have shown, Count Slips enable you to divide up the task
    of Inventory counting. You can use multiple employees and multiple Count
    Slips, yet have all count quantities applied to a single Count Tag.</para>
    <para>Now that all Count Slip quantities have been collected, we are ready
    to post our Count Tag, as shown in the following screenshot:</para>
    <para><anchor id="Anchor71186" role="Cross-Ref"
    xreflabel="71186: Figure: Figure 4.15:  Post Count Tag with Count Slip Comments" />

          <caption>Post Count Tag with Count Slip
          Comments</caption>
        </mediaobject>
      </screenshot></para>
    <para>The cumulative count quantity is displaying as expected. In the
    Current Comments field we see the Count Slip comments posted by each of
    our employees. Again, we want to be sure to thaw the Inventory at posting.
    Finally, we simply select the POST COUNT button, and the system is now
    updated with the most current QOH information for Item B1 in Warehouse
    WEST.</para>

    <para>Throughout this example, we have focused on the creation of single
    Count Tags. But OpenMFG also enables you to create manual Count Tags in
    batches. To see how this is done, we open the Create Count Tags by Class
    Code utility, as shown in the following screen:</para>
    <para><screenshot>

          Code</caption>
        </mediaobject>
      </screenshot></para>
    <para>For this scenario, we will be creating Count Tags for all Items
    belonging to Class Code Books located in Warehouse WEST. A comment is
    entered, and then we then select the CREATE TAGS option. To see the
    resulting Count Tags, we once again open the Count Tag Edit List:</para>
    <para><anchor id="Anchor70270" role="Cross-Ref"

        </mediaobject>
      </screenshot></para>
    <para>As you can see in the example, multiple Count Tags have been
    created&mdash;one for each of the Items fitting our criteria. These Count Tags
    can now be processed using the basic techniques described throughout this
    example.</para>
