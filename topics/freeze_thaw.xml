  <para id="Para672122">The freezing/thawing mechanism is designed to ensure
  you get accurate Inventory counts without having to shut down operations.
  All you have to do is follow these simple steps:</para>

  </orderedlist>
  <para id="Para672127">To give you a better feel for how freezing and thawing
  works, consider the following hypothetical scenarios. These scenarios
  approach the issue of Inventory accuracy from a number of different
  perspectives.</para>

        counted. At this point the count is done, but for some reason the

        column in the diagram, the indicated Quantity on Hand does not equal
        the actual Quantity on Hand. Why? Because the Inventory count did not
        consider ongoing Warehouse activity. The numbers are off--and this is
        a problem.</para>

        it returns an indicated Quantity on Hand of 17. The equation would
        look something like this: 14 + 5 - 2 = 17.</para>
