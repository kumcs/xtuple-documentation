  <para id="Para611232">Beginning with version 2.1.0, OpenMFG has implemented
  a comprehensive and flexible design for taxation intended to address the
  unique requirements for sales Tax around the world. This section illustrates
  how this capability can be adapted to wide-ranging requirements. It also
  offers tips for users migrating from previous releases of OpenMFG.</para>

  <section id="Section611233">
      <title>Overview</title>

      <para id="Para611234">In this scenario, we will show the setup for and
    operation of a simple Tax scheme in which there are two Tax Authorities
    (described as "Tax Zones"). Two Tax Types will also be defined--one for
    Normal Products (Tax Type 1) and one for Educational Products (Tax Type
    2). The same Customer will ship to two different stores, each of which
    will fall under the jurisdiction of a different Tax Authority. In one
    case, Educational Products are taxed at 1% and Normal Products at 5%. In
    the other, both are taxed at 5%. Two Items will be defined--one a normal
    toy truck (YTRUCK1) and the other an educational toy truck (ETRUCK1). We
    will demonstrate how OpenMFG applies the appropriate Tax to each S/O Line
    Item depending on the Item ordered and the Ship-To Address selected. Tax
    Codes have been established to determine the Tax Rate to apply (5% or 1%
    in this example) and the appropriate General Ledger (G/L) Account to
    use.</para>

  <section id="Section611235">
      <title>Creating G/L Accounts for Taxation</title>

      <para id="Para611236">OpenMFG gives you the ability to collect Taxes on
    Sales Orders. There are generally two methods for recording the collection
    of sales Tax in the General Ledger:</para>

            <para id="Para611237">Tax Liability: Taxes collected from Customers
        are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. When the Tax is
        paid, the liability is reduced based on the amount of the payment. In
        this section, we will create two Expense Categories--one for each of
        the Customer scenarios. Each Expense Category is linked not to a G/L
        expense Account (as the name implies) but rather to a liability
        Account corresponding to the type of Tax being paid. When a Voucher
        for a Tax payment is posted, the liability Account linked to the
        Expense Category is cleared and the cash Account on which the Check is
        drawn is charged.</para>

            <para id="Para611238">Tax Revenue: Using the method described above
        assumes that Tax collected from a Customer is revenue and as such is
        posted to a revenue Account in the G/L. Expense Categories are
        established that charge G/L expense Accounts when the Tax is paid to
        the Tax Authority thereby offsetting Tax revenues and Tax expenses on
        the Income Statement.</para>

      <para id="Para611290">Notice that G/L Accounts are also linked to each Tax
    Rate. The same Account may be used for all three Tax Rates--or a different

    reporting purposes.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="Section611291">
      <title>Tax Type Definitions</title>

      <para id="Para611292">Tax Types are linked to Items and Tax Authorities in
    an Item's P/D record. You should think carefully about how to approach Tax
    Types. For example, you may consider creating Tax Types that relate to
    different Tax Authorities. In this case, you might have Tax TYPE10 and Tax
    TYPE15. A single Item could be linked to each--TYPE10 for each Tax
    Authority that taxes it at 10% and TYPE15 for each that taxes it at
    15%.</para>

      <para id="Para611293">A sample Tax Types list is shown in the following
    screen:</para>

      <para id="Para611297">

            </mediaobject>
         </screenshot>
      </para>

      <para id="Para611299">Another strategy is to relate the Tax Type to
    Product Categories. In our scenario, we have Normal Products and
    Educational Products. The relationship between Item, Tax Type, and Tax
    Authority is then established based on how each Tax Authority treats that
    type of product.</para>

      <para id="Para611300">Some Tax Authorities charge Tax on Freight. A
    reserved Tax Type called Freight is pre-populated in the OpenMFG database
    specifically for this purpose. On the Tax Selection screen (see below),
    the freight Tax Type is then linked to a) Tax Authorities that charge Tax
    on freight and b) Tax Codes that contain the appropriate rate.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="Section611301">
      <title>Tax Selection Matrix</title>

      <para id="Para611302">Before we look at an Item and its relationship to
    Tax Types, let's take a look at Tax Selections. The Tax Selections screen
    creates a matrix combining the Tax Type (linked to the Item), the Tax
    Authority (also linked to the Item), and the Tax Code. The following
    screen shows a sample Tax Selections master list:</para>

      <para id="Para611306">

            </mediaobject>
         </screenshot>
      </para>

      <para id="Para611309">Here we see that Tax Authority TAXZONE1 links two
    different Tax Types (one for Normal Products and one for Educational
    Products) to two distinct Tax Codes. Tax Code ZONE1-TYPE1 will calculate
    the Tax at 5% and post it through to a special G/L Account. Tax Code
    ZONE1-TYPE2 will calculate the Tax at 1% and post it through to a
    different G/L Account. Any Tax Type linked to TAXZONE2 will result in a 5%
    Tax calculation defined in the Tax Code ZONE2-TYPE1. A distinct Tax Code
    was defined ONLY because this Tax Code links a G/L Account specifically
    defined to hold Tax Authority TAXZONE2 balances. Were this not desired, a
    single 5% Tax Code could have been use for both TAXZONE1 and
    TAXZONE2.</para>

      <title>Item Tax Type Assignments</title>

      <para id="Para611311">The P/D Item record contains a tab called "Tax
    Types." This tab is used to associate an Item with a Tax Type and
    corresponding Tax Authority.</para>

      <tip>
         <para id="Para611313">The same Tax Type may be taxed differently by

      </para>

      <para id="Para611321">By default, an Item is not taxed if no relationship
    has been created to link it to a Tax Type and Tax Authority. However, it
    may be desirable in some cases to intentionally indicate that an Item is
    not taxed for a specific Tax Authority. If so, you would set this up by
    creating an appropriate Tax Type/Tax Authority relationship on the Item
    master. You would then link this relationship to a Tax Selection record
    pointing to a Tax Code having a 0% Tax Rate. Again, this is optional and
    may or may not be desirable.</para>

      <title>Clearing Tax Liability with Expense Categories</title>

      <para id="Para611323">Because we are charging Customers Tax that we must
