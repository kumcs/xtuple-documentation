  <para id="Para612646">The process of closing Accounting Periods and Fiscal
  Years is simple and straightforward. However, to truly understand the
  process, we must first review several OpenMFG configuration options. To
  begin, we will look at G/L Account Number settings and how they relate to
  Accounting Periods that are open and/or frozen. Next, we will run two
  scenarios based on different configurations of these settings to further our
  understanding. Finally, we will examine important issues to consider before
  closing Accounting Periods and Fiscal Years.</para>

    <title>G/L Account Number Settings</title>
    <para id="Para612648">Two settings on each G/L Account Number definition
    are particularly important in relation to closing Accounting Periods. The

    Number settings impact the closing and reopening of Accounting Periods, we
    will look at two scenarios which take two slightly different approaches.
    The first scenario we will call "safe mode," while the second is called
    "convenience mode. We refer to the first scenario as "safe mode" because
    operating in this manner significantly reduces the chance of
    unintentionally posting into an Accounting Period.</para>
    <para id="Para612686">In this "safe mode" example, we will be using a Cash
    Account called "Cash eBank" and a Supplies Account called "Office
