  <title>Send Document Electronically</title>

  <para id="submitEDIWidget"><informalexample>
      <para>When sending a document electronically, you may be presented with
      one of two screens, depending on whether the document will be sent by
      email or by FTP. If you do not see either screen, that suggests the EDI
      profile has been set to disable review before sending and will
      automatically be sent to the xTuple Connect batch manager.</para>

      <para><note>
          <para>Customers vendors are set up to receive electronic deliveries
          of information using the <guimenuitem>Transmission</guimenuitem> tab
          on the Customer master.</para>
        </note></para>

      <para>If the document will be sent by email, the following screen will
      appear. Please note, the document type will vary depending on the
      context. In this example, an invoice document is being sent:</para>

        <caption><para>Review EDI Before Sending by Email</para></caption>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>The fields at the top of the window show basic information about
      the EDI that will be sent:</para>

      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>Document Type/Number</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>The type of document and document number will vary depending
            on the context. The following document types are supported: quote,
            sales order, invoice, purchase order.</para>

      <para>The information in the following fields will be populated from the

      are presented with the following email-specific options:</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>This is the email address of the primary intended recipient
            of the email. You can add email addresses from a <link

            It can be set to the address of the user running the application
            or a generic address (e.g. "sales@xtuple.com"). If it is left
            blank on this screen, the xTuple Connect batch manager will fill
            in the email address of the user running the application at the
            time the EDI was prepared.</para>

                <listitem>
                  <para>The query set defined in the EDI forms for the EDI
                  profile will be run. The results will be used to build a

                  the drop-down list that appears when <guimenuitem>Delimited

                  If you need to change the delimiter, select <guimenuitem>Not

                  replace that text with your own single character. Normally,
                  however, this should be left to the value specified in the

                  element named for the query that generated it and will
                  contain child elements for the individual fields. Each field
                  of output will be represented by an element with the name of
                  the <guilabel>Query Result</guilabel> column and will

                  element.</para>

                  <para>The resulting XML can be transformed to another format
                  by selecting from the list of XSLT mappings that appears
