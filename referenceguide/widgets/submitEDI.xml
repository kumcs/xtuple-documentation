  <para id="submitEDIWidget"><informalexample>
      <para>When sending a document electronically, you may be presented with
      one of two screens, depending on whether the document will be sent by
      Email or by FTP. If you do not see either screen, that suggests the EDI
      Profile has been set to disable review before sending and will
      automatically be sent to the xTuple Connect Batch Manager.</para>
      <para><note>
          <para>Customers Vendors are set up to receive electronic deliveries
          of information using the "Transmission" tab on the Customer
          master.</para>
        </note></para>
      <para>If the document will be sent by Email, the following screen will
      appear. Please note, the document type will vary depending on the
      context. In this example, an Invoice document is being sent:</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>The type of document and document number will vary depending

      <para>The information in the following fields will be populated from the

          <listitem>
            <para>This is the Email address of the primary intended recipient
            of the Email. You can add Email addresses from a <link

            It can be set to the address of the user running the application
            or a generic address (e.g. "sales@xtuple.com"). If it is left
            blank on this screen, the xTuple Connect Batch Manager will fill
            in the Email address of the user running the application at the

                  with your own single character. Normally, however, this

                  element named for the query that generated it and will
                  contain child elements for the individual fields. Each field
                  of output will be represented by an element with the name of
                  the query result column and will contain the value of that

                  each query showing the query result column names separated
                  by the delimiting character. For HTML, this will insert a
                  row at the beginning of each query's results showing the
                  query results column names. This is ignored for PDF and XML
