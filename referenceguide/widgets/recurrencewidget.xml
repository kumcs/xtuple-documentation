  <title>Recurring</title>
  <para id="recurrenceWidget">When creating a recurring event, you are
  presented with the following options:<informalexample>
      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>Recurring</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>Check this box if you want the event to repeat itself at
            regular intervals, using the frequency settings you specify below.
            Recurring events are generated when you run the recurring items
            utility, which is described in more detail here: <xref
            linkend="createRecurringItems" />.</para>
            <variablelist>
              <varlistentry>
                <term>Every</term>
                <listitem>
                  <para>Enter a number and select a unit of time to describe
                  how frequently you want the event to occur. You can choose
                  any regular schedule, ranging from once every 1 minute to
                  once every 99 years.</para>
                </listitem>
              </varlistentry>
              <varlistentry>
                <term>From</term>
                <listitem>
                  <para>Enter a date and time at which to start the first
                  event. The default value is the time the screen opened. The
                  "From" option only appears on some screens.</para>
                </listitem>
              </varlistentry>
              <varlistentry>
                <term>Until</term>
                <listitem>
                  <para>Enter a date and time after which the event should no
                  longer occur.</para>
                </listitem>
              </varlistentry>
              <varlistentry>
                <term>Create no more than</term>
                <listitem>
                  <para>Enter the maximum number of future copies of this
                  event you want the system to maintain. Whenever the Create
                  Recurring Items screen is run, it will create up to the
                  number you enter here.<warning>
                      <para>If you delete all copies of a recurring event, the
                      event will stop repeating <emphasis>even if the "Until"
                      date has not yet been reached</emphasis>. xTuple
                      recommends setting this to at least 2 to reduce the
                      likelihood of deleting all copies of the event.</para>
