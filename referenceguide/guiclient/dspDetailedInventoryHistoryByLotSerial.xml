  <title>Detailed Inventory History by Lot/Serial #</title>
  <para>Some users need to be able to track warranty periods of Items from the
  purchase of raw materials to the sale of finished goods. Such traceability
  is possible by leveraging the Lot/Serial capability in xTuple ERP. Using
  Lot/Serial trace, users have access to backwards and forwards tracking
  through multiple levels of production--including the where used and warranty
  status of Items.</para>
  <para>For example, if a defective internal medical device came back because
  of a defective spring, a user should be able to determine what Lot of
  springs went into the device--even if the spring was issued to a subassembly
  two levels down. Likewise, once the spring Lot is determined, the user
  should be able to search forward and determine all goods where that Lot of
  springs was used and shipped so all Customers may be notified of the defect.
  If the spring was under warranty and is still eligible, the backward search
  should indicate so.</para>
