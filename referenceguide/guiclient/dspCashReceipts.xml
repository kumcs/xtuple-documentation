  <para>The "Cash Receipts" screen provides historical information about Cash
  Receipts and their applied-to documents. Here are some tips for using this
  screen:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Narrow your searches by funds type, customer type, or distribution
      date range to simplify the process of locating records.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Be sure to select the QUERY button. If you are not seeing any
      results, this is probably the reason why.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>The display by option allows you to view either Cash Receipts
      themselves or the documents they were applied to.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Use the right-click menu to void posted Cash Receipts. When a Cash
      Receipt is voided, any applications will also be reversed. Keep in mind
      that any Credit Memos or Customer Deposits created from the unapplied
      balance when the original Cash Receipt was posted will not be reversed
      when a Cash Receipt is voided. Instead, a misc. Receivables Debit Memo
      will be created in the amount of the original unapplied balance.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>To review Cash Receipt information prior to version 3.3.0, use the
      Receivables Applications report. The "Cash Receipts" screen does not
      support Cash Receipt history prior to version 3.3.0.</para>
    </listitem>
