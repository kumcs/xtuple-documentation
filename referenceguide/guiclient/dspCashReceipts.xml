  <note>
    <para>Prior to xTuple ERP version 3.3.0, Cash Receipt history was not
    retained for use by this screen. As a result, you will not see Cash
    Receipt history for any Cash Receipts entered prior to version 3.3.0.
    Since old Cash Receipt information is not available prior to version
    3.3.0, the Receivables Applications screen should be used until sufficient
    Cash Receipt history is accumulated.</para>

        Cash Receipts, using the specified parameters. From the right-click
        menu you can void posted cash receipts. When a Cash Receipt is voided,
        any applications will also be reversed. Keep in mind that any Credit
        Memos or Customer Deposits created from the unapplied balance when the
        original Cash Receipt was posted will not be reversed when a Cash
        Receipt is voided. Instead, a misc. Receivables Debit Memo will be
        created in the amount of the original unapplied balance.</para>
