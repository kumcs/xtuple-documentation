  <para>The sales credit Edit List displays details on all unposted sales
  credits. The display is a nested list, with a plus ("+") sign located to the
  far left of the screen next to each line that may be expanded to lower
  levels. By clicking your mouse on a plus sign, you reveal lower levels of
  information related to the order.</para>
  <tip>
    <para>If a Billing record displays in red type, this means an Account
    Assignment is missing for the customer type in question. To correct the
    problem, check your sales Account and Accounts Receivable Assignments.
    Once the Assignments are in place, the record will display in black
    type.</para>
