  <title>Run MPS by Planner Code</title>
  <para>When you run MPS by Planner Code, you are running the Master
  Production Scheduling (MPS) system. This utility creates firm Planned Orders
  to meet forecasted demand (i.e., from Production Plans) and also actual
  demand (i.e., from Sales Orders) for MPS Items. An Item is defined as an MPS
  Item on its Item master.</para>
  <para>By default, Planned Orders created by the MPS planning system will be
  firm when they are generated. This establishes them as a legitimate source
  of demand within the wider planning system. The firm-by-default nature of
  MPS Orders distinguishes them from MRP Orders, which must be manually
  firmed.</para>
  <para>The quantities for MPS Planned Orders will vary depending on the
  source of demand. The following considerations are used to identify the
  appropriate demand:</para>
  <orderedlist continuation="restarts" inheritnum="ignore">
    <listitem>
      <para>Actual demand quantity (i.e., from Sales Orders) will be used if
      the planned date for a Production Plan Item falls within the Demand Time
      Fence for that Item; forecasted demand is ignored within the Time
      Fence</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Outside the Demand Time Fence, the system will create Planned
      Orders for whichever demand source is greater—that is, actual demand or
      forecasted demand</para>
    </listitem>
  </orderedlist>
  <tip>
    <para>You might consider running the MRP system after you run MPS. Running
    MRP after MPS will ensure you plan for the materials required to satisfy
    your MPS-driven demand.</para>
  </tip>
  <para>To run MPS by Planner Code, select the "Run MPS by Planner Code"
  option. The following screen will appear:</para>

  <note>
    <para>Only Items designated as MPS Items will have Planned Orders created
    for them when MPS is run. By default, MPS generates firm Planned
    Orders.</para>

        <para>Specify how far into the future the MPS run should look for
        demand. The forecast will be ignored if the planned date for a
        Production Plan Item falls within the Demand Time Fence for that Item.
        Outside the Demand Time Fence, the greater of actual or forecasted
        demand will be used.</para>

  <tip>
    <para>If you schedule an MRP or MPS job submitted to the Batch Manager to
    run on a periodic basis—daily, weekly, monthly—the cutoff date used for
    the run will automatically be updated by the number of days in the
    specified reschedule interval (Day = +1, Week = +7, and Month =
    +30).</para>
