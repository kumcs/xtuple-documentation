  <para>Accounting Periods contain transactional activity within clearly
  defined time periodsâ€•usually months. You will typically find twelve
  Accounting Periods within a Fiscal Year. An Accounting Period must be
  defined in order to post transactions to the General Ledger. If no
  Accounting Period exists, transactions cannot be posted. It is likewise not
  possible to post transactions into closed Accounting Periods. You may only
  post into open Accounting Periods. Privileged users may post into frozen
  Periods, but the frozen Period must be open in order for the posting to
  succeed.</para>
  <note>
    <para>The privilege <literal>PostFrozenPeriod</literal> allows users who
    are granted this privilege to post transactions into frozen Accounting
    Periods. For transactions to post successfully, frozen Periods must also
    be open.</para>
  </note>
