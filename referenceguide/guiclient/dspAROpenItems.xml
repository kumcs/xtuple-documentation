        parameters. The right-click menu includes many options, including the
        ability to enter cash receipts and incidents linked to the receivable.
        You can also void posted invoices and sales credits from the
        right-click menu—as long as they are unapplied. To change the color
        for the following document types, adjust your locale settings:
        customer deposit (alternate) and credit memo (emphasis).</para>

    <para>If you are using the Authorize.Net payment gateway, refunds must be
    processed at least one day after the original charge. Authorize.Net does

    day.</para>
