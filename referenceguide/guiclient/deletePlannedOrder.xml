    <varlistentry>
      <term>Delete Child Orders</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to simultaneously delete child orders for the parent
        planned order. Child planned orders having a clearly defined
        relationship to their parent planned order will be deleted.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <tip>
    <para>In some cases, the "Delete Child Orders" option will not remove all
    the records you may assume it should. To ensure all child orders are
    deleted after a parent planned order is deleted, re-run MRP by planner
    code. Doing so will delete any remaining orphan orders.</para>
