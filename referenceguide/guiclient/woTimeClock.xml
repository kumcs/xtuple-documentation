  <title>Shop Floor Workbench</title>
  <para>The Shop Floor Workbench offers enhanced labor tracking and
  streamlined Work Order processing for either Operations or Production
  posting environments. Its built-in Time Clock functionality ensures precise
  run-time reporting, as Workbench users are required to clock-in to and
  clock-out of Work Orders.</para>
  <para>When posting Operations, users have the option to post either standard
  or specified times&mdash;and the run time recorded will vary depending on the
  option chosen. The standard times are drawn from the Bill of Operations Item
  definitions. By contrast, the specified times are based on the users' clock
  in/out times (i.e., "effort"). The specified effort for an Operation may be
  complicated by the fact that users can be clocked into more than one Work
  Order at a time. In this case, the users' effort will be spread across the
  various Work Orders they have clocked into.</para>
  <para><tip>
      <para>The clock-in requirement applies only to Shop Floor Workbench
      users. If you don"t use the Workbench, no clock-in is required.</para>
    </tip></para>
  <para>Some users may be "Shop Floor Workbench only" users, meaning the only
  screen they see when they log in to xTuple is the Shop Floor Workbench.
  These users do not require any privileges to run the Shop Floor Workbench.
  The ability to post Production or post Operations is "baked into" the "Shop
  Floor Workbench only" user functionality.</para>
  <para>However, if your site is configured to use the "Post Production" style
  for the Shop Floor Workbench, the following privileges may be used to
  enhance the capabilities of Shop Floor Workbench users:</para>

    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para><literal>ChangeNonPickItems</literal></para>
    </listitem>

  <para>By contrast, if you are configured to use the "Post Operations" style,
  the following privileges are available:</para>

  <para>In addition, the following privileges may be assigned to allow for
  accessing Shop Floor Workbench features and reports from the main
  application menu:</para>

      <para><literal>MaintainWoTimeClock</literal> to turn on the ability to

    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>To access the Shop Floor Workbench, select the "Shop Floor Workbench"
  option. The following screen will appear:</para>

    </screenshot></para>
  <note>
    <para>The Shop Floor Workbench must be configured for either Operations
    posting or Production posting. You may not use the Workbench for both
    methods simultaneously. To configure the method used by the Shop Floor
    Workbench, use the Configure Manufacture screen.</para>
  </note>
  <para>When accessing the Shop Floor Workbench, you are presented with the
  following options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Username</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the name of the user wanting to clock-in or clock-out of a
        Work Order. Once a username is entered, the display at the bottom of
        the screen will show all the Work Orders the user is currently
        clocked-in to.</para>
        <tip>
          <para>At the system level, you can restrict a user's privileges so
          the Shop Floor Workbench is the only interface they see when they
          log in to the application.</para>
        </tip>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Work Order #</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the Work Order Number of the Work Order the user wants to
        clock-in to or clock-out of. Only released "R" and in-process "I" Work
        Orders may be processed using the Shop Floor Workbench.</para>
        <note>
          <para>A Work Order must be released "R" before users may clock-in or
          clock out. The release of a Work Order occurs after the Work Order
          has been exploded.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>If the Workbench is configured for Operations-posting, select an
        Operation from the list of Operations. Users are required to clock-in
        and clock-out of individual Operations. This allows run-time
        calculations to be performed on an Operation-by-Operation basis. A
        user may be clocked-in to multiple Operations simultaneously. Also,
        multiple users may be clocked-in to the same Operation. Whatever the
        case, the run-time clock starts when a user(s) clocks in to an
        Operation, and it stops when the user(s) clocks out.</para>

  </variablelist>
  <para>The following buttons are unique to this screen:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>CLOCK IN</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to clock-in to the specified Work Order. When a user
        clocks-in to a Work Order, the run-time clock starts running from that
        point. The clock stops when a user clocks-out of the Work Order. The
        elapsed time&mdash;or "effort"&mdash;is used for labor reporting
        purposes. Users may only clock-in to Work Orders they are not already
        clocked-in to. However, users may clock-in to and clock-out of the
        same Work Order as many times as necessary. Each clock-in starts the
        run-time Time Clock; each clock-out stops it.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>CLOCK OUT</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to clock-out of the specified Work Order. When selected,
        the run-time clock stops for the specified Work Order. The time
        elapsed since the user last clocked-in is added to the run time total
        for the Work Order. This run-time calculation is automatic and cannot
        be overridden&mdash;except by users who have override privileges.
        Users may only clock-out of Work Orders they are already clocked-in
        to. If the Workbench is configured for Operations-posting, the "Post
        Operations" screen will be presented immediately after the CLOCK OUT
        button is selected. By default, the "Scrap Work Order Material
        screen will immediately follow the "Post Operations"
        screen.</para>
        <tip>
          <para>Shop Floor Workbench users should only scrap top-level Items
          after they have posted production sufficient to cover the scrap
          quantity. For example, if a user assembles 10 top-level Items
          successfully but significantly damages the 11th, the user should
          post a quantity of 11 produced and then scrap one (i.e., 11 - 1 =
          10).</para>

      <term>POST PRODUCTION</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>If the Workbench is configured for Production-posting, the Post
        Production screen will be presented immediately after this button is
        selected. The button will be hidden if the Workbench is configured for
        Operations-posting</para>
