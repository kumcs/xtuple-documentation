        <para>Indicate the Item Type for the Invoice Line Item, by selecting
        one of the following options:</para>

            <term>Item</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>The lookup feature located to the right of the field leads
              to a searchable list of Inventory Items. The list will contain
              sold Items available for purchase by the specified Customer. The
              list of available Items may vary from Customer to Customer,
              depending on how Pricing Schedules are implemented at your site.
              Once an Item Number is entered, the Inventory Unit of Measure
              and Item description will automatically appear. Additionally,
              you may also specify the Item's supplying Site. Items may be
              supplied from multiple Sites. Sites designated as "Sold from"
              Sites in the Item Site master for an Item are considered
              "Supplying Sites" on this screen. By default, the Item Site with
              the highest Ranking will be selected as the supplying Site. If
              more than one Item Site share a Ranking of "1", the default
              supplying Site will be selected in alphabetical order. Item
              Sites are ranked using the Ranking mechanism on the Item Site
              master.</para>

              <para>Enter a name and description for the miscellaneous,
              non-Inventory Item you are billing the Customer for. The name
              and description fields are free-form, meaning they accept
              unlimited alphanumeric characters. You must also select a Sales
              Category. Sales Categories are used to identify the General
              Ledger (G/L) Accounts to be used when non-Inventory Sales
              transactions take place.</para>

        <para>If applicable, enter a Customer Part Number to further identify
        the Item you are billing the Customer for. In the case of Inventory
        Items, the Customer Part Number will display automatically if you
        enter an Item Alias in the Item Number field. To enter an Item Alias,
        place the cursor in the Item Number field and then use the keyboard
        shortcut "CTRL + A". After you have entered a valid Item Alias, hit
        the TAB key. A list of Items that use the specified Item Alias will be
        displayed. Select the desired Item from the list. The Item Alias will
        display as the Customer Part Number. Item Aliases are defined on the
        Item master.</para>

      <term>Qty. Ordered</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the quantity of the Item you are billing for. The quantity
        ordered for Inventory Items is measured in the Item's Inventory
        UOM.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <note>
    <para>The Quantity Ordered for Inventory Items is based on the Inventory
    UOM. But the Price is based on the Price UOM. Whenever these two UOMs are
    not identical, the Extended Price for a Line Item will be based on the
    following formula:</para>
    <informalexample>
      <para>(Qty. Ordered) x (Price/Inv. Ratio) x (Net Unit Price)</para>
    </informalexample>
    <para>If for some reason the Prices don"t look correct, check the Item
    master for the Line Item in question. It may be that the Inventory and
    Price UOMs do not exist in a 1:1 relationship.</para>

      <term>Qty. UOM</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the Unit of Measure to be used when selling the Line
        Item. Sold Items may be assigned multiple Selling UOMs. These
        alternate UOMs may be defined on the Item master. If a Line Item has
        no Selling UOM defined, then the Inventory UOM will be used here by
        default.</para>

        </indexterm>Net Unit Price</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Displays the Unit Price for the Invoice Item. By default, the
        system will choose the lower of the following two Prices: A) The
        most-specific Pricing Schedule Assignment or B) any Sale in effect at
        the time of Order entry. The specificity of Pricing Schedule
        Assignments is determined in the following descending order: By
        Customer Ship-To Address (most specific), by Customer, by Customer
        Type, by Customer Type pattern, by all Customers. The lookup feature
        located to the right of the field leads to a Price List screen.</para>
        <note>
          <para>For Inventory Items having assigned Pricing Schedules, the Net
          Unit Price will be automatically calculated using the information
          provided above. For miscellaneous Items, the Net Unit Price must be
          entered manually.</para>
        </note>
        <para>If your Pricing Schedule has multiple Units of Measure (UOM) on
        it (or if several Pricing Schedules share the same level of Price
        specificity, but they have different UOMs) then the UOM which matches
        the selected UOM will be chosen&mdash;that is, as long as the quantity
        break does not exceed the quantity being priced. If no entry matches
        the UOM with a quantity break less than the quantity being priced,
        then the lowest value Price for any UOM will be chosen. To make sure a
        specific UOM is always chosen at the desired level of Price
        specificity, then your Pricing Schedules should include at least one
        UOM with a quantity break of 0.</para>
        <tip>
          <para>The system can be configured to prevent users from editing the
          Net Unit Price. If your system is configured that way, the Net Unit
          Price field will not be editable.</para>

        Item has Selling UOMs defined, then the Item may be sold and priced in
        these alternate UOMs. If no Selling UOMs are defined, then the
