  <para>When displaying Quotes by Customer, you are presented with the
  following options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Customer #</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the Customer Number of the Customer whose Quotes you want
        to view. The lookup feature located to the right of the field leads to
        a searchable Customers list. You may also access this list using the
        keyboard shortcut "CTRL + L". Once a Customer Number is entered, the
        Customer name and billing address will display. Select the "?" or "$"
        symbol to view Customer information for the specified Customer. If a
        Customer's credit is "In Good Standing," the button will feature a
        black question mark ("?") icon. If the icon turns to an orange dollar
        sign ("$"), the Customer's credit Status is "On Credit Warning." A red
        dollar sign ("$") indicates the Customer's credit Status is "On Credit
        Hold."</para>
