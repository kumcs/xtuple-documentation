  <para>If you want Lot/Serial Numbers to be automatically generated when
  receiving Lot/Serial quantity, then you need to set up Lot/Serial sequences.
  The sequences defined here are cross-referenced at the Item Site level. Once
  a link between an Item Site and a sequence is established, Lot/Serial
  Numbers will be automatically generated whenever quantity is received into
  that Item Site. Automatically generated Lot/Serial Numbers may be overridden
  manually, if necessary. Items that require expiration or warranty
  information will still require that information to be entered on the Create
  Lot/Serial screen.</para>
  <note>
    <para>If a user cancels, deletes, or over-writes an automatically assigned
    Lot/Serial Number, the automatically incremented number will not be rolled
    back or reused. This is because there is no way to ensure number issuance
    integrity in an environment where multiple users are posting
    simultaneously&mdash;other than to issue new unused numbers during every
    transaction. The system will, however, check each number it attempts to
    issue. If it finds any existing matches already in the database for the
    given Item, it will skip past them until it finds a previously unused
    number.</para>
  </note>
  <para>To access the list of Lot/Serial sequences, select the "Lot/Serial
  Sequences" option. The following screen will appear:</para>
