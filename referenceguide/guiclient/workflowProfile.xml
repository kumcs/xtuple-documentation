    </indexterm>Workflow Email/Printer Profile</title>
  <para>The workflow email/printer profile has a profile name and description.
  Here, you can turn email notifications on or off. There are options that
  define all of the possible variables and what they are used for. When a
  workflow gets triggered, there is an owner and an assigned user(s). The
  workflow will look up those user email addresses and send them out. The
  email content is based on tokens. You can not build your own infinite tokens
  at this time. You can turn on a print option, in which case a report will be
  generated. The notifications are for steps that are in
  <emphasis>in-process</emphasis> and need another action to be
  taken.<screenshot>

      <term>Email Options</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Identify the sender and recipients of the email as well as the
        subject and content of the email in the following fields:</para>
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>From</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>This is the email address of the person sending the email.
              It can be set to a particular person's email address or to a
              generic address (e.g. sales@xtuple.com).</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>Enter the email address to be used as the default
              recipient address whenever documents are emailed using this
              profile.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>Enter the email address to be used as the default carbon
              copy address whenever documents are emailed using this
              profile.</para>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>BCC</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>Enter the email address to which copies of the email will
              be sent using this profile. BCC differs from CC in that none of
              the recipients will see the BCC addresses. It is a good idea to
              set this to an address that will have its inbox archived or to
              an email address shared by a department. This way there is a
              history of the transmission or the entire department knows what
              has happened.</para>
