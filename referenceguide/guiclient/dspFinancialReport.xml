  <para>Once a financial report has been created using the financial report
  layout tools, you may then generate it using time-phased information. To
  view a financial report, select the <guimenuitem>View Financial
  Report</guimenuitem> option. The following screen will appear:</para>

  <para>When viewing a financial report, you are presented with the following

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Financial Report</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the financial report you want to generate. The list will
        include both system-defined financial reports (e.g., basic income
        statement and basic balance sheet) and also any other reports you may
        have created.</para>

    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Column Layout</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Select the column layout you want the financial report to use.
        This feature may not be used in conjunction with the <guilabel>Trend
        Report</guilabel> option. When defining a financial report using one
        of the standard report types (i.e., balance sheet, income statement,
        or cash flow), you must define a column layout to specify the time
        buckets financial information will be sorted into. A standard
        financial report may have any number of column layouts defined for it.
        Each layout will be linked to either a pre-defined report definition
        or a custom report definition you create yourself. This option will be
        disabled for <emphasis>ad hoc</emphasis> reports, which do not use
        column layouts.</para>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Report Type</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Displays the report type for the financial report you select:
        balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, or <emphasis>ad

        <note>
          <para>The options available on the screen will vary, depending on
          the report type selected. For example, column layouts are not
          available for <emphasis>ad hoc</emphasis> reports.</para>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Periods</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the accounting period(s) whose details you want to
        display. For financial reports created using one of the standard
        report types (i.e., balance sheet, income statement, or cash flow),
        you can only select a single accounting period—unless you are running
        a trend report, in which case multiple periods may be chosen.
        <emphasis>Ad hoc</emphasis> reports may always use either single or
        multiple periods. To select an individual period, highlight the period
        using your mouse button. The period is now selected. To select a
        sequence of periods, highlight the first in the sequence using your
        mouse button. Then, holding down the SHIFT key on your keyboard,
        highlight the last period in the sequence. The entire sequence is now
        selected. To select periods that are out of sequence (e.g., January,
        April, July, October), highlight the first period in the group. Then,
        holding down the CTRL key on your keyboard, highlight the next period
        you want to select. Continue highlighting periods with the CTRL key
        depressed until all desired periods are selected. The entire group is
        now selected.</para>

          <para>You can export the generated financial data in tab-delimited

        <para>For ad Hhoc reports (which do not use column layouts), specify
        the columns of information you want to include in the financial
        report. To be successful, these selections must also match the
        <emphasis>ad hoc</emphasis> report layout. If a column is not
        selected, it will not be included in the report. This option will be
        disabled for non-<emphasis>ad hoc</emphasis> reports, whose column
        choices are defined by column layouts.</para>

        <para>Display lists financial report details for the selected
        financial report, using the specified parameters. This display is a
        nested list, with a plus ("+") sign located to the far left of the
        display next to each financial report group that may be expanded to
        lower levels. By clicking your mouse on a plus sign, you reveal lower
        levels of information related to the group. From the layout, you can
        right-click on individual accounts to view the underlying G/L
        transaction detail. The right-click feature is context-sensitive and
        works only on rows that contain G/L account numbers and columns that
        contain numbers for actual G/L account total values.</para>

      <term>NOTES</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Select to add notes which will appear at the bottom of the
        financial report when the financial report is printed. Notes entered
        here must be associated with a specific accounting period. These notes
        are saved and remain associated with the accounting period. They will
        be included whenever you print a financial report that includes the
        accounting period. If the <guibutton>NOTES</guibutton> button is
        disabled, that means you have not selected a single, specific
        accounting period to write the notes to. For example, you cannot write
        notes on a trend report. You can, however, write notes on all the
        accounting periods covered by a trend report and then print the trend
        report and see the notes listed at the bottom. The notes entered here
        do not conflict with notes entered on the financial report definition
        itself. Those notes will also be printed at the bottom of the
        financial report—regardless of the reporting periods selected.</para>
