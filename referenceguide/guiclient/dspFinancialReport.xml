  <para>Once a Financial Report has been created using the Financial Report
  layout tools, you may then generate it using time-phased information. To
  view a Financial Report, select the "View Financial Report" option. The
  following screen will appear:</para>

  <para>When viewing a Financial Report, you are presented with the following

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Financial Report</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the Financial Report you want to generate. The list will
        include both system-defined Financial Reports (e.g., basic Income
        Statement and basic Balance Sheet) and also any other reports you may
        have created.</para>

      <term>Report Type</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Displays the report type for the Financial Report you select:
        Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow, or Ad Hoc.</para>
        <note>
          <para>The options available on the screen will vary, depending on
          the report type selected. For example, column layouts are not
          available for Ad Hoc reports.</para>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Column Layout</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select the column layout you want the Financial Report to use.
        This feature may not be used in conjunction with the "Trend Report"
        option. When defining a Financial Report using one of the standard
        report types (i.e., Balance Sheet, Income Statement, or Cash Flow),
        you must define a column layout to specify the time buckets financial
        information will be sorted into. A standard Financial Report may have
        any number of column layouts defined for it. Each layout will be
        linked to either a pre-defined report definition or a custom report
        definition you create yourself. This option will be disabled for Ad
        Hoc reports, which do not use column layouts.</para>

      <term>Periods</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the Accounting Period(s) whose details you want to
        display. For Financial Reports created using one of the standard
        report types (i.e., Balance Sheet, Income Statement, or Cash Flow),
        you can only select a single Accounting Period&mdash;unless you are
        running a Trend Report, in which case multiple Periods may be chosen.
        Ad Hoc reports may always use either single or multiple Periods. To
        select an individual Period, highlight the Period using your mouse
        button. The Period is now selected. To select a sequence of Periods,
        highlight the first in the sequence using your mouse button. Then,
        holding down the SHIFT key on your keyboard, highlight the last Period
        in the sequence. The entire sequence is now selected. To select
        Periods that are out of sequence (e.g., January, April, July,
        October), highlight the first Period in the group. Then, holding down
        the CTRL key on your keyboard, highlight the next Period you want to
        select. Continue highlighting Periods with the CTRL key depressed
        until all desired Periods are selected. The entire group is now
        selected.</para>

        <para>For Ad Hoc reports (which do not use column layouts), specify
        the columns of information you want to include in the Financial
        Report. To be successful, these selections must also match the Ad Hoc
        report layout. If a column is not selected, it will not be included in
        the report. This option will be disabled for non-Ad Hoc reports, whose
        column choices are defined by column layouts.</para>

        <para>Display lists Financial Report details for the selected
        Financial Report, using the specified parameters. This display is a
        nested list, with a plus ("+") sign located to the far left of the
        display next to each Financial Report Group that may be expanded to
        lower levels. By clicking your mouse on a plus sign, you reveal lower
        levels of information related to the group. From the layout, you can
        right-click on individual Accounts to view the underlying G/L
        transaction detail. The right-click feature is context-sensitive and
        works only on rows that contain G/L Account Numbers and columns that
        contain numbers for actual G/L Account total values.</para>

      <term>NOTES</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to add Notes which will appear at the bottom of the
        Financial Report when the Financial Report is printed. Notes entered
        here must be associated with a specific Accounting Period. These Notes
        are saved and remain associated with the Accounting Period. They will
        be included whenever you print a Financial Report that includes the
        Accounting Period. If the NOTES button is disabled, that means you
        have not selected a single, specific Accounting Period to write the
        Notes to. For example, you cannot write Notes on a trend report. You
        can, however, write Notes on all the Accounting Periods covered by a
        trend report and then print the trend report and see the notes listed
        at the bottom. The Notes entered here do not conflict with Notes
        entered on the Financial Report definition itself. Those Notes will
        also be printed at the bottom of the Financial Report&mdash;regardless
        of the reporting periods selected.</para>
