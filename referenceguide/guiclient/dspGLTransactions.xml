  <para>The "G/L Transactions" screen is a great tool for locating information
  about the complete range of General Ledger transaction activity. From this
  screen you can locate every transaction posted to the G/L. And using the
  custom search tools, you can narrow down your search to locate the specific
  records you are looking for.</para>
  <para>Here are some tips for using this screen:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Use the right-click menu to drill down into the details of
      individual transactions.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>If your transaction records are displaying a "No" value in the
      "Posted" column, this means the transactions were not posted into an
      Accounting Period because one doesn't exist or the Accounting Period was
      frozen/closed at the time of posting. Once you create an Accounting
      Period for the time Period in question, your transaction records will
      display "Yes" in the posted column.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Among its many features, the G/L Transactions query builder
      includes an option to display "deleted" transactions.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>The total quantity of G/L transactions will be greatly reduced if
      your site is configured to post transactions to an intermediate Journal
      before they are posted to the G/L. To learn more about this
      configuration option, please see <xref linkend="Section942568" />.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>When Project Accounting enabled, there is a search parameter
      designed to show Accounts with a Project Number as the last segment. If
      the "Show Project Detail" option is not used, balances will roll up into
      the parent Account total.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
