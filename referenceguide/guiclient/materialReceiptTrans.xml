      <term>Receipt Qty.</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Record the quantity of the Item being received. The Item's
        Quantity on Hand before and after the material receipt will also be
        displayed. Non-netable Quantity on Hand is not included in these
        values. If the material is issued directly to a Work Order, the before
        and after display will be bypassed.</para>

      <term>Immediate Issue to Work Order</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Check to issue material immediately to a Work Order. Any Work
        Order Material Requirements having an issue method of either "Mixed"
        or "Push" may be issued to a Work Order using this option. Because
        "Pull" Items are issued to Work Orders using a material backflush,
        they may not be issued from this screen.</para>

  <note>
    <para>The full quantity being received will be issued to the Work Order if
    the "Immediate Issue" option is selected. This means the quantity issued
    may exceed or fall short of the Work Order Material Requirement quantity.
    In such cases, adjustments at the Work Order level may have to be made to
    bring the issued quantity into alignment with the required quantity. To
    avoid having to manage discrepancies, do not select this option. Instead,
    consider issuing materials manually.</para>
