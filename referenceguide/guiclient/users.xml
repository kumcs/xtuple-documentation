  <para>By default, all xTuple ERP user records are integrated with the user
  records on the PostgreSQL server instance where the xTuple ERP database is
  running. This integration makes for flexible system administration. Several
  of the user access options available to system administrators are described
  here: <xref linkend="databaseInformation" />.</para>
  <para>We recommend that you restrict access to this section to a limited
  number of people. The following screen will appear when you select the
