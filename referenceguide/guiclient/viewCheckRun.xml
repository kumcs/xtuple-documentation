        <para>Highlight a Payment in the list of Payments and then select this
        button to post the Payment. If the specified Bank Account requires
        printing, the Payment must be printed or marked as already

        Payment may be posted immediately. See the "Printed" column in the
        display to determine a Payment's printed status. The following
        additional option is provided:<variablelist>

        button to void the Payment. Voided Payments may not be printed or
        posted. When a Payment is voided, the payable amount will be reopened
        on the Select Payments screen. In other words, if a Payment for
        $100.00 is voided, that amount will once again be made available for
        payment on the Select Payments screen. The reopened amount will again
        be associated with the referring payable Document (i.e., Voucher or

        before they can be replaced. When a voided Payment is replaced, the
