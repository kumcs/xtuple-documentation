        <para>Enter the Customer Number of the Customer whose Cash has been

        to a searchable Customers list. You may also access this list using
        the keyboard shortcut "CTRL + L". Once a Customer Number is entered,
        the Customer name and billing address will display. Select the "?" or
        "$" symbol to view Customer information for the specified Customer. If
        a Customer's credit is "In Good Standing," the button will feature a
        black question mark ("?") icon. If the icon turns to an orange dollar
        sign ("$"), the Customer's credit Status is "On Credit Warning." A red
        dollar sign ("$") indicates the Customer's credit Status is "On Credit
        Hold."</para>
