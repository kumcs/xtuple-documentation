  miscellaneous debit memo. To enter a cash receipt, go to

  <para>When entering a cash receipt, you are presented with the following
  options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Customer #</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the customer number of the customer whose cash has been
        received. The lookup feature located to the right of the field leads
        to a searchable customers list. You may also access this list using
        the keyboard shortcut <guibutton>CTRL + L</guibutton>. Once a customer
        number is entered, the customer name and billing address will display.
        Select the <guibutton>?</guibutton> or <guibutton>$</guibutton> symbol
        to view customer information for the specified customer. If a
        customer's credit is good, the button will feature a black question
        mark (<guibutton>?</guibutton>) icon. If the customer is on credit
        warning, the icon will turn into an orange dollar sign
        (<guibutton>$</guibutton>). A red dollar sign
        (<guibutton>$</guibutton>) indicates the customer is on credit
        hold.</para>
        <tip>
          <para>If you receive an overpayment from a customer, you can go
          ahead and apply the full payment to an invoiceâ€”even if the amount
          exceeds the invoice amount. In these cases, the system will
          automatically generate an unapplied credit memo for the customer, in
          the overpayment amount.</para>

      <term>Customer Group</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the name of the customer group whose invoices you want to
        apply cash to. When you enter a customer group in this field, any open
        invoices for customers belonging to the group will be shown. Cash
        receipts for customer groups must be fully-applied before the cash
        receipt can be posted. If partially-applied, you will be prevented
        from posting the cash receipt until all the funds are applied to open
        invoices for customers in the customer group.</para>
