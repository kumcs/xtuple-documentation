  miscellaneous debit memo. To enter a cash receipt, go to

  <para>When entering a cash receipt, you are presented with the following
  options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Customer #</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the customer number of the customer whose cash has been
        received. The lookup feature located to the right of the field leads
        to a searchable customers list. You may also access this list using
        the keyboard shortcut <guibutton>CTRL + L</guibutton>. Once a customer
        number is entered, the customer name and billing address will display.
        Select the <guibutton>?</guibutton> or <guibutton>$</guibutton> symbol
        to view customer information for the specified customer. If a
        customer's credit is good, the button will feature a black question
        mark (<guibutton>?</guibutton>) icon. If the customer is on credit
        warning, the icon will turn into an orange dollar sign
        (<guibutton>$</guibutton>). A red dollar sign
        (<guibutton>$</guibutton>) indicates the customer is on credit
        hold.</para>
        <tip>
          <para>If you receive an overpayment from a customer, you can go
          ahead and apply the full payment to an invoice—even if the amount
          exceeds the invoice amount. In these cases, the system will
          automatically generate an unapplied credit memo for the customer, in
          the overpayment amount.</para>

      <term>Customer Group</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the name of the customer group whose invoices you want to
        apply cash to. When you enter a customer group in this field, any open
        invoices for customers belonging to the group will be shown. Cash
        receipts for customer groups must be fully-applied before the cash
        receipt can be posted. If partially-applied, you will be prevented
        from posting the cash receipt until all the funds are applied to open
        invoices for customers in the customer group.</para>
