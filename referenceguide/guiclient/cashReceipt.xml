  <para>When entering a Cash Receipt, you are presented with the following
  options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Customer #</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the Customer Number of the Customer whose Cash has been
        received. The browse button located to the right of the field leads to
        a searchable Customers list. You may also access this list using the
        keyboard shortcut "CTRL + L". Once a Customer Number is entered, the
        Customer name and billing address will display. Select the "?" or "$"
        symbol next to the browse button to view Customer information for the
        specified Customer. If a Customer's credit is "In Good Standing," the
        button will feature a black question mark ("?") icon. If the icon
        turns to an orange dollar sign ("$"), the Customer's credit Status is
        "On Credit Warning." A red dollar sign ("$") indicates the Customer's
        credit Status is "On Credit Hold."</para>

    <para>If you receive an overpayment from a Customer, you can go ahead and
    apply the full Payment to an Invoice—even if the amount exceeds the
