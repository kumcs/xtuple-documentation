  <para>Worksheets are documents used to capture time and expenses for
  employees and contractors. When worksheets are created, they appear on this
  Worksheets screen where managers can review and approve them all in one
  place.</para>

  <para>The following set up information will help ensure your worksheets are
  complete when you process them:</para>

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Employees</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Should have compensation rate defined, but billing rate is
        optional. The compensation rate is used to determine the labor cost of
        employees when their time entries are posted to the general ledger
        (G/L). The billing rate may be used when employees are doing billable
        work for a customer, depending on the billing rate hierarchy defined
        for the customer. To ensure employees can be reimbursed for their
        expenses, employees must also be defined as vendors in the
        system.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Contractors</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Should also have compensation rate, but billing rate is
        optional. For contractors, the compensation rate is used to determine
        the amount owed to contractors for their time entries. Contractor
        costs are not posted directly as a labor cost, as they are for
        employees. Instead, contractor time is vouchered and then checks are
        written to the contractorsâ€”thereby closing the vouchers. Because
        contractors are paid both for their time and their expenses,
        contractors must be defined as vendors in the system. Like employees,
        the billing rate for contractors may be used when contractors are
        doing billable work for a customer, depending on the billing rate
        hierarchy defined for the customer.</para>
