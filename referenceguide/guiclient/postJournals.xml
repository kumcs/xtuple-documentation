  <para>If your system is configured to post transactions to intermediate
  Journals (sometimes also referred to as "day books"), it is important that
  you periodically post transactions from the Journals to the General Ledger.
  The reason for this is that the trial balance and other financial reports
  draw their information solely from the General Ledger. If Journal
  transactions are not posted to the General Ledger, then they will not be
  included in the system's financial reports.</para>
  <para>One advantage to using intermediate Journals is that transactions are
  summarized when they are posted over to the General Ledger. In this way,
  transaction detail remains in the Journals, with the summarized version of
  that detail residing in the General Ledger. You can post Journals to the
  General Ledger on a daily, monthly, or weekly basis. It's up to you how you
  want to implement this feature. But again, keep in mind that financial
  reports will only be updated when Journal transactions are posted over to
  the General Ledger.</para>
  <para>To review and post Journals to the General Ledger, select the "Post
  Journals to Ledger" option. The following screen will appear:</para>
