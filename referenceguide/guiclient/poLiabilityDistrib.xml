  <para>When marking a line item receipt as invoiced, you are presented with
  the following options:</para>

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Account</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Select the account you want to use opposite the P/O liability
        clearing account. When this transaction is posted, the P/O liability
        clearing account will be debited with the distribution amountâ€”and the
        account you specify will be credited. In this way, you will be sure to
        clear P/O liability when marking receipts as invoiced outside of the
        typical vouchering process flow.</para>
