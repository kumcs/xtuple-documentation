      <listitem>
        <para>Select a number using the arrow buttons, or manually enter a
        value up to a maximum of 99. This feature enables you to schedule work
        order Materials with work order Operations. For example, let's say we
        have an Operation with an Execution Day = 5. This means the Operation
        is scheduled to begin five days after the start date of the work
        order. Components scheduled with this Operation are due the day before
        the Operation starts—that is, on day four after the work order start
        date—to ensure they will be available when the Operation is scheduled
        to begin. If this option is not selected, then the component
        scheduling will be governed by the start and due dates set on the Work
        Order header. Based on the values entered for all listed Operations,
        whichever Execution Day value is the maximum, that value will be
        displayed as the production Lead Time for the Routing.</para>

              <para>The system enables you to specify when an operation can be

              existing item—but that new design will not be available for use
              until a given date in the future. In this case, you can specify
              the "effective" date when the component will be available for

              is planned to be obsoleted from (i.e., no longer used in) a Bill
              of Materials. As mentioned above, the company's engineering
              department may be working on a new design for an existing
              item—but that new design will not be available for use until a
              given date in the future. In this case, the old component item
              must be marked for "expiration" on a given date. This expiration
              date will most likely coincide with the effective date of the
              replacement part. Setting this parameter will instruct the
              system to stop using the specified component on the date entered
              into this field.</para>

        Operation. Specifying a standard batch size helps ensure your
        Operations Costs are evenly distributed. The following equation
