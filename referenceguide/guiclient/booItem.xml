      <listitem>
        <para>Select a number using the arrow buttons, or manually enter a
        value up to a maximum of 99. This feature enables you to schedule Work
        Order Materials with Work Order Operations. For example, let's say we
        have an Operation with an Execution Day = 5. This means the Operation
        is scheduled to begin five days after the start date of the Work
        Order. Components scheduled with this Operation are due the day before
        the Operation starts&mdash;that is, on day four after the Work Order
        start date&mdash;to ensure they will be available when the Operation
        is scheduled to begin. If this option is not selected, then the
        component scheduling will be governed by the start and due dates set
        on the Work Order header. Based on the values entered for all listed
        Operations, whichever Execution Day value is the maximum, that value
        will be displayed as the production Lead Time for the Bill of
        Operations.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the operation's effectivity, using the following
        parameters:</para>
        <para>Effective: The system enables you to specify when an operation
        can be used in a Bill of Materials. For example, the company's
        engineering department may be working on a new design for an existing
        Item&mdash;but that new design will not be available for use until a
        given date in the future. In this case, you can specify the
        "effective" date when the component will be available for use.</para>
        <para>Expires: The system also enables you to specify when an
        operation is planned to be obsoleted from (i.e., no longer used in) a
        Bill of Materials. As mentioned above, the company's engineering
        department may be working on a new design for an existing
        Item&mdash;but that new design will not be available for use until a
        given date in the future. In this case, the old component Item must be
        marked for "expiration" on a given date. This expiration date will
        most likely coincide with the effective date of the replacement part.
        Setting this parameter will instruct the system to stop using the
        specified component on the date entered into this field.</para>
        <note>
          <para>Standard Operations are intended as initial templates used to
          set up Bill of Operations (BOO) Items. Any changes made to a
          Standard Operation will not automatically ripple throughout all your
          BOO Items that use the Standard Operation.</para>
