  <note>
    <para>Only firm Planned Orders will be included in the MRP Detail display.
    If a Planned Order is not firmed, it will not be recognized. This
    limitation pertains also to MRP Items which may be associated with MPS or
    Planning Items. While firm MPS Orders may exist, Planned Orders for the
    underlying MRP Items must be firmed (or released) before the MRP Detail
    display will recognize them.</para>
