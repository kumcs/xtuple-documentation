  <para>Custom Screens are screens you can design, using QtDesigner, and then
  run within your xTuple ERP application. Essentially, a screen is a UI form
  which specifies widgets and layout information. Just like scripts, screens
  are stored in your xTuple database using the functionality described in this
  section. To take advantage of this functionality, you should have a basic
  understanding of how to program using <ulink
  url="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm">ECMAScript</ulink>
  and create UI screens using <ulink
  url="http://trolltech.com/products/qt/features/tools/designer">QtDesigner</ulink>.</para>
  <para><tip>
      <para>You can read more about creating custom screens and scripting in
      the Development Zone of our wiki at <ulink
      url="http://www.xtuple.org">www.xtuple.org</ulink>.</para>
    </tip>When creating a new screen, the first thing to do is give it a name.
  This name is then used to find matching scripts. Screens can be enabled or
  disabled&mdash;as well as have an order. You may have several screens with
  the same name; however, only the lowest enabled screen is used. In addition,
  you must export or import the UI file (i.e., you cannot edit the UI file
  directly on the database). And, creating a screen does not automatically
  make it available to users. You must first create a custom command to make
  sure the screen is added to the menu structure, as described here: <xref
  linkend="customCommandTitle" />.</para>
  <note>
    <para>Because screens are very limited in what they can be made to do
    without code or scripting, it will almost always be necessary to write one
    or more scripts for a screen.</para>
  </note>
  <para>To view the master list of available custom screens, select the
  "Screens" option. The following screen will appear:</para>
  <para><screenshot>
      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/uiforms.png" />
        </imageobject>
        <caption>Screens Master List</caption>
      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot></para>
  <para>The screens master list displays information on all custom screens,
  including screen name, description, order, and enabled status. If the screen
  is part of a larger package, the name of the parent package will be
  displayed&mdash;with all the child screens appearing in a nested list below
  it. Select the "Organize By Package" option to see an indented view of the
  screens and the package they belong to.</para>
  <para>The following buttons are unique to this screen:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>TEST</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Highlight a custom screen and then select this button to launch
        the screen in the xTuple ERP application. If successful, the
        highlighted screen will appear within the xTuple framework (e.g., on
        the desktop). If the screen does not appear, then check your
        settings&mdash;and be sure you have imported your source UI file into
        the database.</para>
