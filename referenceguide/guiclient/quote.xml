  <para>A quote is a statement issued to a customer or Prospect indicating
  pricing and sales terms for specified quantities of sold items. Quotes are
  often precursors to sales orders. To create a quote, select the "New Quote"
  option. The following screen will appear:</para>

        If there are no existing line items, the date entered here will become
        the default schedule date for the first one. If line items do exist
        and the date is changed, you will be asked whether you want all

      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the customer number of the customer (or Prospect) to be
        billed for the sale. The lookup feature located to the right of the
        field leads to a searchable customers list. The lookup feature will be
        disabled if the quote is entered for a Prospect. You may also access
        the customer list using the keyboard shortcut "CTRL + L". Once a
        customer number is entered, the customer name and billing address will
        display. Select the "?" or "$" symbol to view customer information for
        the specified customer. If a customer's credit is "In Good Standing,"
        the button will feature a black question mark ("?") icon. If the icon
        turns to an orange dollar sign ("$"), the customer's credit Status is
        "On Credit Warning." A red dollar sign ("$") indicates the customer's
        credit Status is "On Credit Hold." You may also create a new customer
        record by selecting the "+" button.</para>
        <tip>
          <para>A valid customer number must be entered in the "Customer #"
          field before line items can be added to a quote. If no valid
          customer number is entered, you will not be able to add line items
          to the quote. Additionally, quotes may only be entered for active
          customers.</para>

          <para>Quotes may not be entered for customers whose credit status is

      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the sales representative?or Outside Rep, in the

        are linked to a customer on the Customer masterâ€”either by a default
        setting or through the assignment of ship-to addresses. Each ship-to
        address may have a different sales representative associated with it.
        Consequently, the name of the sales representative appearing on the
        Quote header will be the same as specified for the ship-to address
        being used. If you are using the Enhanced Commissions package, the
        sales rep information is moved to a separate tab.</para>
        <note>
          <para>When creating a new quote, only active sales reps will be
          available for selection. For future changes to an existing quote,
          all sales reps (active and inactive) will be listed to ensure that

        configured to show quotes after they have been converted, you may view
        historical quotes from the Customer Workbench. Converted quotes will

              <listitem>
                <para>Enter the item number of the item you want to sell. The
                item list will contain sold items available for sale to the
                specified customer. The list of available items may vary from
                customer to customer, depending on how Pricing Schedules are
                implemented at your site. Once an item number is entered, the
                inventory unit of measure and item description will
                automatically appear.</para>

                Items may be supplied to sales orders from multiple item
                sites. After an item number is entered above, the system
                checks for available item sites for the item. Any item sites
                having the "Sold from" flag set on them will be selectable
                from this site list. By default, the item site having the
                highest Ranking will be selected as the first available site.
                If more than one item site share a Ranking of "1," the sites
                will be sorted in alphabetical order. Item site Rankings are
                set on the Item Site master.</para>

        <para>If your site is configured to use Projects, select a Project

        automatically be entered here. Once a Project Number is associated
        with a sales order, any work orders or purchase orders created by the
        sales order demand will automatically be linked to the same Project
        Number as the sales order. In this way, sales orders, work orders, and
        purchase orders may be linked to the same Project.</para>
