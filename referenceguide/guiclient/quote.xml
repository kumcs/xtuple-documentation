        <para>Displays the Order's earliest scheduled date. The scheduled date
        corresponds to the earliest scheduled date for an included Quote Item.
        If there are no existing Line Items, the date entered here will become
        the default schedule date for the first one. If Line Items do exist
        and the date is changed, you will be asked whether you want all
        editable lines to change. If the change affects pricing, you will be
        asked whether you want Prices to be updated as well. If hidden, this
        field can be viewed by selecting the MORE button.</para>

        Sales Representatives are linked to a Customer on the Customer
        masterâ€”either by a default setting or through the assignment of
        Ship-To Addresses. Each Ship-To Address may have a different Sales
        Representative associated with it. Consequently, the name of the Sales
        Representative appearing on the Quote header will be the same as
        specified for the Ship-To Address being used.</para>

        <para>By default, the commission percentage recorded on the Customer
        master will be automatically entered in this field. If for some reason
        you select a non-default Sales Representative at Order entry, the

        have been converted to Sales Orders. If your Sales module is
        configured to show Quotes after they have been converted, you may view
        historical Quotes from the Customer Workbench. Converted Quotes will

        <para>Enter the Customer Number of the Customer (or Prospect) to be

        the Customer list using the keyboard shortcut "CTRL + L". Once a
        Customer Number is entered, the Customer name and billing address will
        display. Select the "?" or "$" symbol to view Customer information for
        the specified Customer. If a Customer's credit is "In Good Standing,"
        the button will feature a black question mark ("?") icon. If the icon
        turns to an orange dollar sign ("$"), the Customer's credit Status is
        "On Credit Warning." A red dollar sign ("$") indicates the Customer's
        credit Status is "On Credit Hold." You may also create a new Customer
        record by selecting the "+" button.</para>
        <tip>
          <para>A valid Customer Number must be entered in the "Customer #"
          field before Line Items can be added to a Quote. If no valid
          Customer Number is entered, you will not be able to add Line Items

        weight represents the sum of an Item's product weight and packaging

        freight weight multiplied by the quantity per gives you the Line Item
