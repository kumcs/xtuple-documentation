  <title>Work Order Buffer Status by Class Code</title>
  <para>The Work Order buffer status displays provide information on your
  current stock and time buffer levels for those Items having current Work
  Orders. Stock buffers apply to make-to-stock Items; whereas time buffers
  apply to Items which are make-to-order. Keep in mind that buffer status
  information will only be displayed on days when the Constraint Management
  system is run. If you find your displays show no information, this probably
  means Constraint Management has not been run.</para>
  <para>To view Work Order buffer status by Class Code, select the "Work Order
  Buffer Status by Class Code" option. The following screen will
  appear:</para>

    </screenshot></para>
  <note>
    <para>When the buffer status for an Item hits 66 or higher, the status
    number will become red. By highlighting Items which are "red hot," the
    system is informing you which Items should be acted on immediately. The
    best remedy for red hot Item Sites is to expedite any associated Work
    Orders or Purchase Orders.</para>

  <note>
    <para>By default, the display will sort Work Orders by buffer status in
    descending order. In other words, Work Orders with the highest buffer
    status will appear at the top of the list; Work Orders with the lowest
    buffer status will appear at the bottom.</para>
