  <para>Count tags are used to spearhead inventory counts. They are created
  manually and on-demand, and they are not tied to any particular cycle or
  frequency, as cycle count tags are. To create a count tag by item, select
  the <guimenuitem>Create Count Tag by Item</guimenuitem> option. The
  following screen will appear:</para>

  <para>When creating count tags by item, you are presented with the following
  options:</para>

  <tip>
    <para>By default, the system allows only one unposted count tag per item
    site. To view all unposted count tags in your system, see the count tag
    edit list.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the item number of the item you want to create a count tag
        for. The lookup feature located to the right of the field leads to a
        searchable list of make and buy items.</para>

        <para>Specify the site you want the count tag created for. This field
        will remain blank until you enter an item number into the
        <guilabel>Item Number</guilabel> field. Once that is entered, the
        site(s) where the item is located will display in the list.</para>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Mark Created Count Tag as Priority</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Select to give priority status to count tag. Count tags marked
        as having priority status are listed first in any prioritized lists.
        For example, priority count tags will appear at the top of the count
        tag edit list; whereas, non-priority count tags will appear at the
        bottom of the list.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Select to freeze inventory. The quantity on hand (QOH) value is
        not updated when a transaction is posted against a frozen item site.
        Instead, inventory transactions are pooled and then posted later when
        the item site is unfrozenâ€”or thawed. The QOH is updated when the item
        site is thawed.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>

  <note>
    <para>When an item site is frozen, any inventory transactions entered
    against that item site will not update the system-wide QOH until after the
    item site is thawed and its count tag posted. If an item site is frozen
    when a count tag is created, both the inventory count and the
    corresponding general ledger (G/L) transactions will use the count tag
    created (i.e., frozen) date when the count tag is posted.</para>

      <term>Only for Specified Location</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Select if you want to create count tags for an individual site
        location. If selected, you will have the option to specify which site
        location you want to have count tags created for. This option enables
        you to count individual site locations separately, without having to
        post counts for an entire site all at once.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>

  <note>
    <para>An item must have multiple location control (MLC) turned ON to take
    advantage of the count tags by location feature. If the item is not
    multiply-located, then this option will not be available.</para>
