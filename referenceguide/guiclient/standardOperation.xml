      <term>Tool Reference</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Use this field to briefly describe any tooling required for the
        Operation. For example, if you are making plastic products, the
        tooling reference might refer to the mold used to form the
        plastic.</para>

        </indexterm>Production UOM</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the Unit of Measure to use for the Production
        UOM&mdash;or enter a free-form UOM. Specify a UOM to be used
        optionally when Work Order Operations are posted for the specified
        Operation. Operations may be posted using either the Inventory or
        Production UOM. In addition, different Operations in a single Bill of
        Operations may use different Production UOMs. For example, if you are
        producing soup, you might mix the soup in one Operation using UOM =
        BATCH. But when canning the soup, the canning Operation might use UOM
        = CAN. If you post Operations using the Production UOM, the
        Inventory/Production UOM ratio normalizes the posting so that the
        Inventory impact is recorded using the Inventory UOM.</para>

    <para>When posting Work Order Operations, you are given the option to post
    Operations using Production UOMs or Inventory UOMs.</para>

      <term>Inventory/Production UOM Ratio</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>When Work Order Operations are posted using the Production UOM,
        the Inventory/Production UOM ratio normalizes the posting so that the
        Inventory impact is recorded in the Inventory UOM. The ratio is set up
        in the same way as the Capacity/Inventory UOM ratio described in <xref
        linkend="item" />.</para>

    <para>Labor and overhead Costs associated with setup and run times must be

      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the standard quantity that will be produced during a
        typical run-time period. The value entered here is equivalent to a run
        size, batch size, or Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) for this particular
        Operation. Because Work Order Operations roll into the Actual and
        Standard Costs for manufactured Items, you should specify a per
        quantity which accurately reflects your normal batch size for the
        Operation. Specifying a standard batch size helps ensure your
        Operations Costs are evenly distributed.</para>
