      <term>Tool Reference</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Use this field to briefly describe any tooling required for the
        operation. For example, if you are making plastic products, the
        tooling reference might refer to the mold used to form the
        plastic.</para>

          <secondary>in operations</secondary>
        </indexterm>Production UOM</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the unit of measure (UOM )to use for the production
        UOMâ€”or enter a free-form UOM. Specify a UOM to be used optionally when
        work order operations are posted for the specified operation.
        Operations may be posted using either the inventory or production UOM.
        In addition, different operations in a single routing may use
        different production UOMs. For example, if you are producing soup, you
        might mix the soup in one operation using UOM = BATCH. But when
        canning the soup, the canning operation might use UOM = CAN. If you
        post operations using the production UOM, the inventory/production UOM
        ratio normalizes the posting so that the inventory impact is recorded
        using the inventory UOM.</para>
        <note>
          <para>When posting work order operations, you are given the option
          to post operations using production UOMs or inventory UOMs.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>When work order operations are posted using the production UOM,
        the inventory/production UOM ratio normalizes the posting so that the
        inventory impact is recorded in the inventory UOM. The ratio is set up
        in the same way as the capacity/inventory UOM ratio described in <xref
        linkend="item" />.</para>

        times will be associated with the standard operation if

          <para>Labor and overhead costs associated with setup and run times
          must be reported if they are to be tracked in the G/L and elsewhere.
          To report setup and run times, select the appropriate boxes in the

        <para>Specify the standard quantity that will be produced during a
        typical run-time period. The value entered here is equivalent to a run
        size, batch size, or economic order quantity (EOQ) for this particular
        operation. Because work order operations roll into the actual and
        standard costs for manufactured items, you should specify a per
        quantity which accurately reflects your normal batch size for the
        operation. Specifying a standard batch size helps ensure your
        operations costs are evenly distributed.</para>
