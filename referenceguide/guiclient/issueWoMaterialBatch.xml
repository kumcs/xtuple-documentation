  <note>
    <para>Unless your system is configured to allow material issues to
    exploded work orders, you may only issue materials to released or
    in-process work orders. For more information about issuing to exploded
    work orders, please see <xref linkend="AllowIssue"/>.</para>

  <para>When issuing work order material requirement items in a batch, you are
  presented with the following options:</para>

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Transaction Date</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the date you want the transaction to be posted to the
        general ledger. The current day's date will display by default.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Work Order #</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the work order number of the work order whose component
        items you want to issue in a batch.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Site</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Displays site code automatically when work order number is
        entered into <guilabel>Work Order #</guilabel> field.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Item Number</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Displays work order item number automatically when work order
        number is entered into <guilabel>Work Order #</guilabel> field.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>UOM</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Inventory unit of measure.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Status</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Displays work order status automatically when work order number
        is entered into <guilabel>Work Order #</guilabel> field.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Method</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Indicates whether selected work order is an Assembly or
        Disassembly work order.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Issue Items not on Pick List</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Select to indicate that non-pick list items should also be
        issued to the work order. Items are defined as pick list items on the
        Item master screen.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>W/O Material Requirements</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Display lists work order material requirements. The display is
        color-coded for ease of use. If an item's issue method is "Pull," then
        that item—and the entire row it sits on—will appear in blue type. The
        blue type indicates that the batch issue utility will not affect these
        items. By definition, pulled items are backflushed, not issued.
        However, if an item's issue method is "Push," then that item—and the
        row it sits on—will appear in black type. Rows with black type are
        affected by the batch issue utility. One other color may also appear.
        If the quantity required by the work order exceeds the quantity on
        hand (QOH)—meaning there is an inventory shortage—the value in the
        "Short" column will display in red.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>

  <note>
    <para>If you are issuing lot/serial items to a work order, these cannot be
    issued automatically from a default location. You must individually select
    and then distribute the desired lot/serial quantity.</para>
