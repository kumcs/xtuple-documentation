  <para>Addresses may be associated with and shared by contacts, sites,
  ship-tos, and vendors. You can create address records from this screen using
  the NEW button. Or you can create addresses right on the screens where they
  are used. For example, if you are entering information for a new contact,
  you can create the address record on the Contact screen. That address will
  automatically be added to the master list of addresses.</para>
