    </indexterm>Journal Series</title>

  <para>When transactions are posted in the system—either to the general
  ledger or intermediate journals, depending on your accounting
  configuration—the grouping of debits and credits associated with the
  transaction is considered to be a journal series. Each series is categorized
  by module and assigned a unique journal number.</para>

  <para>From the Journal Series screen you can review your transaction
  series—and also take action, when needed.</para>

  <note>
    <para>The following transaction series types may be reversed: simple
    journal entry, series journal entry, standard journal, and standard
    journal group. The same transaction series types may also be deleted
    (simple and series journal entries may also be edited)—but only if they
    were posted directly to the general ledger. You cannot edit or delete
    transactions posted to intermediate journals.</para>
  </note>

  <tip>
    <para>When a transaction has been deleted, it remains in the database and
    may still be viewed using the <guilabel>Show Deleted</guilabel> option on
    the General Ledger Transactions screen. Similarly, when you edit a simple
    or series journal transaction, the original transaction is marked as
    deleted—and the new, edited version is posted in its place. Transactions
    found in closed or frozen periods—or if they were part of a bank
    reconciliation—may not be modified.</para>
  </tip>

  <para>To view transaction series for either the general ledger or journals
  (depending on your configuration), select the <guimenuitem>Journal
  Series</guimenuitem> option. The following screen will appear:</para>
