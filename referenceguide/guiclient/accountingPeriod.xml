  <para>When creating a new Accounting Period, you are presented with the
  following options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Name</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter a name to describe the Accounting Period. This name will
        be used as the Period's column header text when a Financial Report is
        generated. If not specified, then the Period's start and end dates
        will be used as the column header text. When a new period is added,
        the beginning and end dates default to the next logical month. Dates
        are not editable on periods with adjacent periods or when trial
        balance activity exists.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Start Date</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the start date for the Accounting Period. Start Date is
        only editable if all periods are open.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>End Date</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the end date for the Accounting Period. End Date is only
        editable on a period when it is the last period and there is no trial
        balance activity in it.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Fiscal Year</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select Fiscal Year from the drop down list.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Number</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select Accounting Period number. This feature provides the
        ability to customize your accounting periods so that you're not
        limited to monthly accounting periods.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Quarter</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select which quarter the accounting period belongs to. </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Quarter</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select Quarter from the drop down list.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Closed</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to indicate the Accounting Period is closed. You may not
        close an Accounting Period until a subsequent Period has been created.
        If an Accounting Period is closed, Trial Balances for the Period may
        not be updatedâ€”except for Accounts which specifically allow posting
        into closed Periods. Reopening a closed Accounting Period will cause
        any pending Account activity to be posted into the Period.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <note>
    <para>The Trial Balances for an Accounting Period will automatically
    forward-update at the moment when the Accounting Period is closed. Also,
    the system will automatically reset the beginning balances for Revenue and
    Expense Accounts to $0 at the start of a new Fiscal Year.</para>
  </note>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Frozen</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to indicate the Accounting Period is frozen. You may not
        freeze an Accounting Period unless the Period is already closed. Trial
        Balances may not be updated for Accounting Periods which are frozen.
        This restriction applies to all Accounts, even those Accounts which
        may be posted into closed Accounting Periods. Trial Balances may only
        be updated for Accounting Periods which are not frozen. If this option
        is not selected, the Accounting Period is considered not
        frozen.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <note>
    <para>The "Closed" and "Frozen" options apply only to Trial Balances.
    Account activity is always posted to the General Ledger (G/L) regardless
    of whether Accounting Periods are closed or frozen.</para>
