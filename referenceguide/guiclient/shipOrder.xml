      <term>Approve for Billing</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify this option to approve the sales order for Billing as
        soon as it is shipped. If selected, the Order will appear on the
        Billing Approvals list—making it available to be converted into an
        invoice. This option will be selected by default if specified in your
        system-level configuration. This option will be disabled if a Transfer
        Order is specified.</para>

        <para>Specify this option to automatically create and print an invoice
        for the sales order as soon as it is shipped. Selecting this option
        enables you to bypass the Billing Selection process. Once the Order is
        shipped, an invoice will be created and printed. This invoice will
        appear on the list of unposted invoices—making it available for
        posting. By default, the "Select for Billing" option will also be
        selected. This option will be disabled if a transfer order is
        specified.</para>

        sales order is specified.</para>
        <tip>
          <para>The system will move transfer order items to the specified
          Transit site when the Order is shipped. If the Order is marked to be
