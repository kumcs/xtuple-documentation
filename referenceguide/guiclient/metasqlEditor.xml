        <caption>Create New MetaSQL Statement</caption>
      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot></para>

  <para>The MetaSQL Editor can be used to create new MetaSQL Statements or
  edit those already found on the MetaSQL Statements master list. Once
  created, new MetaSQL Statements can be added to the master list, making them
  available for use in the application. To edit an existing MetaSQL Statement,
  simply load the statement into the editor from the Database you are
  currently connected to. Then edit the statement and save it back to the
  Database once editing is complete.</para>

  <para>The body of the MetaSQL Statement is an SQL SELECT, UPDATE or DELETE
  statement (the user must have been granted the ExecuteMetaSQL privilege to
  run the UPDATE or DELETE statement). Passed parameters can be utilized to
  control how the statements operates (using an IF, ELSE, ENDIF construct) and
  their values can be inserted. The core Postbooks application contains many
  statements that can be used as examples.</para>

  <para>The Editor toolbar has icon shortcuts for New, Open, Save, Undo, Cut,
  Copy to clipboard and Paste from clipboard. The Editor menu has many options
  to simplify the development of MetaSQL Statements including viewing and
  editing the Parameter List, executing the query, and viewing the query
  results.</para>

  <para>When saving a new MetaSQL Statement, you are presented with the
  following options:</para>

  </variablelist>

  <para>After defining the save options, you are presented with the following
  options:</para>

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Schema</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>You would normally select the "public" schema, however, there
        are situations where you may want to define the MetaSQL Statement in a
        different schema.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Group</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the Group for the MetaSQL Statement. This is the major
        grouping for statements and normally reflects the type or source of
        information. Some examples are arHistory, purchaseOrders, etc.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Name</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the Name for the MetaSQL Statement. This is detailed name
        for the statement within the Group.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Grade</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the Grade number for the MetaSQL Statement. If there are
        multiple MetaSQL Statements with the same Group/Name, the one with the
        highest Grade number will be used. It is a good idea to save changes
        to statements with a higher Grade number so you if necessary can refer
        to the original statement before the changes. Use the menu option
        File-&gt;Save As Database to change the Grade of a statement.</para>
