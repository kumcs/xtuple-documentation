  <para>Purging Invoice records is one method for freeing up disk storage
  space&mdash;without losing important sales history. Running this utility
  will also purge the whole chain of documents associated with an Invoice. The
  chain of documents which will be purged when this utility is run include the
  following: Invoices (<literal>invchead</literal>,
  <literal>invcitem</literal>); Return Authorization
  (<literal>rahead</literal>, <literal>raitem</literal>,
  <literal>rahist</literal>); Lot/Serial Registrations
  (<literal>lsreg</literal>); Sales Orders (<literal>cohead</literal>,
  <literal>coitem</literal>, <literal>payco</literal>,
  <literal>backup_payco</literal>); Shipments (<literal>shiphead</literal>,
  <literal>shipitem</literal>, <literal>pack</literal>); and Billing
  (<literal>cobmisc</literal>, <literal>cobill</literal>). Again, running this
  utility will not purge sales history. That information is retained for
  historical sales analysis purposes.</para>
  <para>To purge Invoices and their associated documents, select the "Purge
  Invoices" option. The following screen will appear:</para>
