  <para>When displaying Work Order History by Work Order Number, you are
  presented with the following options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Work Order #</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the Work Order Number of the parent Work Order whose
        history you want to view. The field accepts only parent Work Order
        Numbers. Child Work Order Numbers&mdash;those containing a dash and a
        number following the Work Order Number&mdash;will not be recognized.
        This field supports pattern matching.</para>
        <tip>
          <para>To search all work orders leave Work Order # blank and click
          Query. Can also limit search by entering partial Work Order number.
          For example, to search all Work Orders containing the number 50,
          enter 50 in Work Order # and click Query.</para>
        </tip>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Only Show Top Level Work Orders</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to show only top level Work Orders in the "Work Orders"
        display.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Show W/O Cost</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to include the current posted value of the Work Order in
        the display. The posted value is equal to the total cost accumulated
        on the Work Order, including both labor and materials. The posted
        value will be the same as the WIP value until the point when finished
        goods are received. Ultimately, once Production (or Operations)
        posting is completed, the posted value will be equal to the received
        value. If these two values are different, then a variance will
        result.</para>
