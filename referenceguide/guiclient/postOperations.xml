  <para>Work Order progress can be posted in terms of materials used or
  Operations completed. When you post Operations, you are using the
  Operations-driven process for reporting progress. To post Work Order
  Operations, select the "Post Operations" option. The following screen will
  appear:</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>Select to post the Operations quantity in Production Units
              of Measure. Operations may be posted using either the Inventory
              or Production UOM. In addition, different Operations in a single
              Bill of Operations may use different Production UOMs. For
              example, if you are producing soup, you might mix the soup in
              one Operation using UOM = BATCH. But when canning the soup, the
              canning Operation might use UOM = CAN. If you post Operations
              using the Production UOM, the Inventory/Production UOM ratio
              defined at the Operation level normalizes the posting so that
              the Inventory impact is recorded using the Inventory UOM.</para>

      <term>Issue Components</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Indicates that linked component materials will be issued
        automatically (i.e., backflushed) when the specified Operation is
        posted. Option will be enabled only if component materials are linked
        to the specified Operation within the parent Item's Bill of Materials.
        If such linkages exist, only components with "Pull" or "Mixed" issue
        methods will be displayed. Components having the "Push" issue method
        will not appear in the list, as these must be issued manually to a
        Work Order. If this option is selected, the General Ledger will show
        the component materials being removed from Inventory when this
        Operation is posted.</para>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Receive Inventory</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Indicates that finished goods will be received into Inventory
        when the specified Operation is posted. Enabled only when the selected
        Operation is the receiving Operation for the selected Work Order. Only
        one Work Order Operation may have this flag set. If this option is
        selected, the General Ledger will show the finished goods being

        Typically, standard times will not be used if Operations are being
