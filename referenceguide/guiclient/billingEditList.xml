  <para>To edit an Order selected for billing, or to view detailed information
  about selected Orders, choose the "Billing Edit List" option. The following
  screen will appear:</para>

    </screenshot></para>
  <tip>
    <para>In cases where a large number of Orders have been selected for
    billing, data may be slow to display on the Billing Edit List&mdash;given
    the quantity of detail provided. For a faster-loading view of the same
    Orders, use the Billing Selections list, which provides only higher level
    details and so loads more quickly.</para>
  </tip>
  <para>The Billing Edit List displays details on all Orders selected for
  billing. The display is a nested list, with a plus ("+") sign located to the
  far left of the screen next to each line that may be expanded to lower
  levels. By clicking your mouse on a plus sign, you reveal lower levels of
  information related to the Order.</para>
  <tip>
    <para>If a Billing record displays in red type, this means an Account
    Assignment is missing for the Customer Type in question. To correct the
    problem, check your Sales Account and Accounts Receivable Assignments.
    Once the Assignments are in place, the record will display in black
    type.</para>
