  <para>When setting up a new Site, you have the ability to create batches of
  Item Sites&mdash;rather than having to create them one-at-a-time. To create
  Item Sites by Class Code, select the "Create Item Sites by Class Code"
  option. The following screen will appear:</para>

              were to change the quantity of that Work Order, the Event

              start date falls within the Event Fence for the Item Site, an

              Item, then the Lead Time refers to the production Lead Time. If

              Items is determined on a Vendor-by-Vendor basis, using Item
              Source masters. Material Requirements Planning (MRP) will

              <para>Specify the length of the Demand Time Fence by using the
              arrow buttons or manually entering a value up to a maximum of
              999. The Demand Time Fence (also known as the demand fence) is
              used by the Master Production Scheduling (MPS) system to
              evaluate when forecasted demand (i.e., from Production Plans)
              should be used in place of actual demand (i.e., from Sales
              Orders)&mdash;and vice versa. Measured in days, the Demand Time
              Fence is the period of time extending from the current day to
              the number of days into the future as specified in this field.
              The Demand Time Fence option applies only to those Items which
              currently appear on a released Production Plan. If demand for
              these Items falls within the Demand Time Fence period, then the
              Forecast will be ignored. If demand falls outside the Demand
              Time Fence, then the larger of actual or forecasted demand will
              be used. MPS responds to the demand it locates by creating firm
              Planned Orders for the required quantities.</para>
