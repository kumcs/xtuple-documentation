  <para>When setting up a new site, you have the ability to create batches of
  item sites—rather than having to create them one-at-a-time. To create item
  sites by class code, select the <guimenuitem>Create Item Sites by Class

              only. When a maximum order quantity is specified, MRP will
              ignore order multiples and minimum order specifications—focusing
              instead solely on the maximum order setting. For example, if the
              maximum order quantity is set to 10 and there is demand for 17,

              a value up to a maximum of 999. Specifies the Lead Time for the
              specified item, measured in days. If the item is a manufactured
              item, then the Lead Time refers to the production Lead Time. If
              the item is a purchased item, then the Lead Time refers to the
              planning Lead Time. The procurement Lead Time for purchased
              items is determined on a vendor-by-vendor basis, using Item
              Source masters. Material requirements planning (MRP) will
              consider Lead Times when calculating planned order start dates
              when MRP is run.</para>

            <term>MPS Time Fence</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>Specify the length of the Demand Time Fence by using the
              arrow buttons or manually entering a value up to a maximum of
              999. The Demand Time Fence (also known as the demand fence) is
              used by the Master production Scheduling (MPS) system to
              evaluate when forecasted demand (i.e., from production Plans)
              should be used in place of actual demand (i.e., from sales
              orders)—and vice versa. Measured in days, the Demand Time Fence
              is the period of time extending from the current day to the
              number of days into the future as specified in this field. The
              <guilabel>Demand Time Fence</guilabel> option applies only to
              those items which currently appear on a released production
              Plan. If demand for these items falls within the Demand Time
              Fence period, then the Forecast will be ignored. If demand falls
              outside the Demand Time Fence, then the larger of actual or
              forecasted demand will be used. MPS responds to the demand it
              locates by creating firm planned orders for the required
              quantities.</para>
