  <para>The Receivables Aging report gives you the ability to view open Receivables in a
  bucketed, time-phased perspective. An open Item is recognized by the Receivables
  Aging report "as of" the item's document or distribution date, depending on
  your preference. In the case of Invoices, the document date is the Invoice
  date. The distribution date is the date the Invoice shows up in the General
  Ledger (G/L). For example, if you post an Invoice on January 1, but the
  Invoice date is February 15, then the "as of" document date will be February
  15. This means, if you run the Receivables Aging report with an "as of" document
  date in January, the open item with an Invoice date of February 15 will not
  appear in the report. In fact, it will not appear in the report until an "as
  of" document date of February 15 or later is specified. Conversely, using
  the distribution date option, the Invoice would appear "as of" January
  1.</para>
  <tip>
    <para>You can view the document date for an open item by right-clicking on
    a line in the Receivables Aging display. You can also find open item details on
    other screens&mdash;for example, Receivables Workbench, Customer History, Open
    Items by Customer, etc.</para>
  </tip>
  <para>The grouping of open items into time-phased buckets is driven by a
  document's due date. In other words, if a due date falls within 0-30 days of
  the "as of" date specified when the report is run, then the open item will
  appear in the first bucket. If the due date falls 31-60 days past the
  specified "as of" date, then the open item will appear in the second bucket.
  And so on. But again, keep in mind that the document date for an open
  Receivable (e.g., Invoice date) must be on or before the specified "as of" date
  for the item to be recognized by the report. To view open Receivables from an aging perspective, select the "Receivables
  Aging" option. The following screen will appear:</para>

        The report will include any Receivable items which were open&mdash;that is,
        not yet paid&mdash;as of the specified date. This feature provides
        "point-in-time" open balance functionality. But again, keep in mind
        that the document date for an open Receivable (e.g., Invoice date) must
        be on or before the specified "as of" date for the item to be
        recognized by the report.</para>
