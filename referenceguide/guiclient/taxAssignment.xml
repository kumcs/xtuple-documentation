  <para>When creating a new tax assignment, you are presented with the
  following options:</para>

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Tax Zone</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the tax zone you want to associate with the tax
        assignment. If you select the <guilabel>Any</guilabel> option, this
        means any defined tax zone is a possible match.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Tax Type</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the tax type you want to associate with the tax
        assignment. If you select the <guilabel>Any</guilabel> option, this
        means any defined tax type is a possible match.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Tax Code</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Use the <guibutton>ADD-&gt;</guibutton> and
        <guibutton>&lt;-REVOKE</guibutton> buttons to specify the tax codes
        you want to associate with the tax assignment.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Automatically Apply to AP/AR Memos</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Select if you want linked tax code rate(s) to be automatically
        applied to miscellaneous credit/debit memos. This feature is designed
        primarily to support value added tax (VAT) scenarios. If this option
        is not selected, tax will not be calculated automatically for
        memos.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Apply Reverse Charges</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Select if you want reverse charges to be applied. This feature
        is designed primarily to support VAT scenarios. For example, a
        VAT-registered company in the United Kingdom buys supplies from a
        VAT-registered company in a different European country. In this
        scenario, a double entry has to be created for debit and credit so
        that VAT ends up being zero.</para>
