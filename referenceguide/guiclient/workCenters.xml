  <para>Work Centers are collections of machines or labor that perform a
  specific task when building a manufactured Item. Work Centers are used by
  Bills of Operations to determine the amount of available and required
  manufacturing Capacity to produce the manufactured Item. Work Centers also
  determine the Cost, in direct labor, overhead, and, optionally, machine
  overhead, of such production. A single Site may contain multiple Work
  Centers. To access the master list of Work Centers, select the "Work
  Centers" option. The following screen will appear.</para>
