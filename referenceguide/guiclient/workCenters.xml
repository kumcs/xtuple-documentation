  <para>Work centers are collections of machines or labor that perform a
  specific task when building a manufactured item. Work centers are used by
  routings to determine the amount of available and required manufacturing
  capacity to produce the manufactured item. Work centers also determine the
  cost, in direct labor, overhead, and, optionally, machine overhead, of such
  production. A single site may contain multiple work centers. To access the
  master list of work centers, go to <guimenuitem>Work Centers</guimenuitem>.
