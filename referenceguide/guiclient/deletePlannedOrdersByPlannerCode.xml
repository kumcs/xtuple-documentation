      <listitem>
        <para>Select to delete existing firmed orders. A firm planned order is
        a planned order that has been solidified in the schedule. Firm planned
        orders will not be deleted unless this option is selected.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Select to simultaneously delete child orders for the parent
        planned order. Child planned orders having a clearly defined
        relationship to their parent planned order will be deleted.</para>

  </variablelist>

  <tip>
    <para>In some cases, the <guilabel>Delete Child Orders</guilabel> option
    will not remove all the records you may assume it should. To ensure all
    child orders are deleted after a parent planned order is deleted, re-run
    MRP by planner code. Doing so will delete any remaining orphan
    orders.</para>
