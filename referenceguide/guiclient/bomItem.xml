              <para>The system enables you to specify when a component can be
              used in a Bill of Materials. For example, the company's
              engineering department may be working on a new design for an
              existing Item—but that new design will not be available for use
              until a given date in the future. In this case, you can specify
              a future "effective" date to indicate when the component will be

            <listitem>
              <para>The system also enables you to specify when a component is
              planned to be obsoleted from (i.e., no longer used in) a Bill of
              Materials. As mentioned above, the company's engineering
              department may be working on a new design for an existing
              Item—but that new design will not be available for use until a
              given date in the future. In this case, the old component Item
              must be marked for "expiration" on the date when the new Item
              becomes effective. Setting this parameter will instruct the
              system to stop using the specified component on the date entered
              into this field.</para>

      <term>Fixed Qty.</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Use this option to specify a "flat" quantity of material
        required that is independent of the total quantity produced on a batch
        or Work Order. For example, tooling Items added to a Bill of Materials
        generally have a fixed quantity regardless of the total quantity of
        finished goods produced. Batch size does have an impact on the costing
        for fixed quantity Items, however. For example, if the parent Item's
        batch size is 100 and the cost of the fixed quantity Item is $100,
        then the fixed Item's cost should be distributed across the batch, as
        in the following: ((1/100) * $100) = $1.</para>
        <tip>
          <para>To ensure fixed quantity Item costs are distributed accurately
          across an entire batch, make sure you select the "Fractional" option
          on the Item master for the Item. If the Item is not fractional, then
          the batch size conversion may not prorate the fixed quantity costs
          accurately.</para>

          <para>Using the "Create Child W/O at Parent W/O Explosion" option

        <para>Select to create Work Orders for manufactured components when
        their parent Items are exploded. This option applies only to
        manufactured Items appearing as components on a Bill of Materials. If
        selected, a Work Order will automatically be created for the
        manufactured component when the parent Item is exploded. The impact on
        Work Order numbers will be visible. For example, a "-1" will be
        appended to the parent level Work Order and a "-2" to the child level
        Work Order—as in, #1061-1 and #1061-2. If this option is not selected,
        a child Work Order will not be created when the parent Item is
        exploded.</para>
        <note>
          <para>The "Create Child W/O at Parent W/O Explosion" option will
          cause the creation of lower level Work Orders BOTH at Work Order
          explosion and also during the explosion that takes place during
          Master Production Scheduling (MPS) and Material Requirements
          Planning (MRP) runs.</para>

              Orders by a specific material issue transaction. Because a
              specific material issue transaction must be used, "Push" Items
              enable you to monitor material usage variances. Standard issue
              quantities are not automatically backflushed to Work Orders, as
              is true for "Pull" Items. If a component Item uses the "Push"
              issue method, you must manually issue quantities to Work
              Orders.</para>

              <para>Select if you want the component Item to be issued to Work
              Orders by a material backflush. "Pull" Items are automatically
              issued to Work Orders when Work Order Production is posted.
              Using the "Pull" issue method saves time, since materials do not
              need to be manually issued to Work Orders by a specific material
              issue transaction.</para>

              the issue method applied to it initially—that is, either "Pull"
              or "Push." Assigning the "Mixed" issue method to a component
              Item gives you the flexibility of deciding on a
              Work-Order-by-Work-Order basis whether you want to assign the
              "Pull" or "Push" method to the component Item.</para>

        is used at. Linking a component with an Operation will have certain
        effects. First, when posting Operations, components that are linked to
        a given Operation will be backflushed if the issue method for the
        components is either "Pull" or "Mixed" and the Operation is set to
        Auto Issue components. Secondly, Work Order paperwork, such as

        scheduling of Operations is handled by the Execution Day indicator on

        Operation with an Execution Day = 5. This means the Operation is
        scheduled to begin five days after the start date of the Work Order.
        Components scheduled with this Operation are due the day before the
        Operation starts—that is, on day four after the Work Order start
        date—to ensure they will be available when the Operation is scheduled
        to begin. If this option is not selected, then the component
        scheduling will be governed by the start and due dates set on the Work

  <para>On a Bill of Materials, if the parent Item is a configured Item (i.e.,
  configured Job Item or Reference Item), then you will have the option to
  link BOM Items to specific parent Item Characteristics. For example, let's
  say the parent Item has a Characteristic for paint finish with the values
  "Flat" and "Glossy". At the BOM Item level, you can specify whether the BOM
  Item goes with "Flat" or "Glossy". If you choose "Glossy" to associate with
  the BOM Item, then that means the BOM Item will be included as a material
  requirement whenever Orders call for the "Glossy" version of the parent
  Item. If no Characteristic association is made at the BOM Item level, then
  the BOM Item will always appear on Work Orders—regardless of the
  parent-level configuration selection. To associate Characteristics with a
  BOM Item, select the "Configuration" tab. The following screen will
  appear:</para>

  <para>When associating Characteristics with a BOM Item, you are presented
  with the following options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Characteristic</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select a Characteristic from the list of Characteristics. These
        Characteristics are Item Characteristics defined on the Item master
        for the parent Item on the Bill of Materials. Linking parent
        Characteristics to child BOM Items means the child Item will be
        included as a material requirement whenever Orders call for the same
        parent Item Characteristic.</para>
