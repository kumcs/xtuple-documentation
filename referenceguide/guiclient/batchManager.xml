  <title>Batch Manager</title>
  <para>The Batch Manager is an application which connects to one or more
  databases and waits for and then processes batched jobs that need to be run.
  These batched jobs are submitted from various places within the application.
  Often the type of jobs that can be submitted are jobs that either take long
  periods of time to run or jobs that you would want to run periodically at a
  given time. When you submit a job to the Batch Manager, you specify a time
  for the job to start running. This job and others like it are stored on the
  database, waiting for the Batch Manager to process them. You can see a list
  of jobs submitted to the Batch Manager by selecting the "Batch Manager"
  option from the System module.</para>
  <note>
    <para>For details on installing and setting up the Batch Manager at your
    site, please see the Batch Manager documentation available in the
    Downloads area of the xTuple community website.</para>
  </note>
  <para>To access the system interface to the Batch Manager, select the "Batch
  Manager" option. The following screen will appear:</para>

  <note>
    <para>When a report or other job is submitted to the Batch Manager with a
    scheduled time of ASAP, the Batch Manager sets the scheduled time to the
    current time. However, a job will not necessarily be run immediately if it
    is scheduled for the current time. Any pre-existing jobs with scheduled
    times prior to the current time must be completed first. In other words,
    ASAP jobs will not necessarily be run immediately. Previously scheduled
    jobs will be run first.</para>
