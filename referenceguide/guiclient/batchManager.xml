  <title>xTuple Connect Console</title>
  <para>The xTuple Connect Batch Manager is an application which connects to a
  database and waits for and then processes scheduled jobs that need to be
  run. These scheduled jobs are submitted from various places within the
  xTuple ERP application. Often the type of jobs that can be submitted are
  jobs that either take long periods of time to run or jobs that you would
  want to run periodically at a given time. When you submit a job to the Batch
  Manager, you specify a time for the job to start running. This job and
  others like it are stored on the database, waiting for the Batch Manager to
  process them. You can see a list of jobs submitted to the Batch Manager by
  selecting the "xTuple Connect Console" option from the System module.</para>
  <note>
    <para>For details on installing and setting up the Batch Manager at your
    site, please see the xTuple Connect Product Guide available in the
    Documentation area of the xTuple community website.</para>

  <para>To access the system interface to the Batch Manager, select the
  "xTuple Connect Console" option. The following screen will appear:</para>

  <note>
    <para>When a report or other job is submitted to the Batch Manager with a
    scheduled time of ASAP, the Batch Manager sets the scheduled time to the
    current time. However, a job will not necessarily be run immediately if it
    is scheduled for the current time. Any pre-existing jobs with scheduled
    times prior to the current time must be completed first. In other words,
    ASAP jobs will not necessarily be run immediately. Previously scheduled
    jobs will be run first.</para>
  </note>
  <para>When managing Scheduled Jobs using the xTuple Connect Console, you are
  presented with the following options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Submitted by</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the user(s) whose Batch Items you want to
        display.</para>
        <para>Current User: Select to display Batch Items for the current
        user.</para>
        <para>All Users: Select to display Batch Items for all users.</para>
        <para>Selected User: Specify the user whose Batch Items you want to
        display.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Show Completed Actions</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to include completed Scheduled Jobs in the
        display.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Jobs</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Displays Scheduled Jobs using the specified parameters.
        Completed jobs will have a Run Status of <literal>Done</literal> and a
        Completed timestamp. If the job failed for any reason, the first line
        of the error message will appear in the Exit Status column. If you
        allow the cursor to hover over the Exit Status text, the full version
        will appear in a tooltip window.</para>
        <note>
          <para>Read the exit status carefully. Jobs might show error messages
          for a number of different reasons. For example, a RunMRP job might
          fail with a database error or with an email error. The database
          error would mean that the planned orders were not created. The email
          failure would indicate that the planned orders were created as they
          should but this successful processing could not be reported
          properly.</para>
