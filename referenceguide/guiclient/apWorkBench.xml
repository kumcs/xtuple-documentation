  <para>The Payables workbench groups together in one location a range of
  current payables information, giving you the option to sort this information
  by individual vendor—or by all vendors or smaller subsets of vendors. To
  access the Payables workbench, go to <guimenuitem>Accounting &gt; Accounts
  Payable &gt; Workbench</guimenuitem>. The following screen will
  appear:<screenshot>

  <para>The <guimenuitem>Vouchers</guimenuitem> tab displays information on
  all unposted vouchers, including voucher number, purchase order number,
  vendor number/vendor name, vendor invoice number, and distribution date.
  Users with the appropriate privilege will also see the <guilabel>G/L
  Distribution Date</guilabel> column.</para>

  <note>
    <para>Actual costs for purchased items will be automatically updated when
    vouchers are posted if there are differences between current actual costs
    and the vouchered costs for the items in question. Please keep in mind
    that actual costs only will be updated at posting. For new costs to be
    recognized as standard costs, actual costs must be posted to
    standard.</para>

  <tip>
    <para>If you have a purchase order voucher that was corrupted by, for
    example, a sudden power outage, you can clear the record by running the
    Post Vouchers screen. In most cases, this action will remove the corrupted
    record and allow you to voucher the purchase order with a fresh
    voucher.</para>

        Ledger (G/L) on their distribution date. However, users with the
        appropriate privilege may change the G/L distribution date to an
        alternate date during the voucher posting process. If used, vouchers
        will post on the alternate date. The ability privileged users have to
        change the distribution date applies to the posting of both individual
        and also batches of vouchers from this screen.</para>
