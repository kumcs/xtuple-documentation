  <para>Units of Measure represent the standard amount in which quantities of
  an Item are managed (e.g., "EACH," "POUNDS," "GALLONS," etc.). To access the
  master list of Units of Measure, select the "Units of Measure" option. The
  following screen will appear.</para>

  <para>The "Units of Measure" screen displays information on all existing
  Units of Measure, including Unit of Measure name and description.</para>
  <note>
    <para>Users may also enter free-form UOMs wherever UOM definitions are
    required&mdash;for example, in the Item master. The ability to enter free-form
    UOMs provides flexibility so that all the UOMs your site requires do not
    need to be previously added to the UOM master list.</para>
