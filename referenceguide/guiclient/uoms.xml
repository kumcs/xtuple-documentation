  <para>Units of measure (UOM) represent the standard amount in which
  quantities of an item are managed (e.g., "EACH," "POUNDS," "GALLONS," etc.).
  To access the master list of UOM, select the <guimenuitem>Units of
  Measure</guimenuitem> option. The following screen will appear.</para>

    </screenshot></para>

  <para>The Units of Measure screen displays information on all existing UOM,
  including UOM name and description.</para>

  <note>
    <para>Users may also enter free-form UOMs wherever UOM definitions are
    requiredâ€”for example, in the Item master. The ability to enter free-form
    UOMs provides flexibility so that all the UOMs your site requires do not
    need to be previously added to the UOM master list.</para>
