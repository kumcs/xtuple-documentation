  <title>W/O Operation Buffer Status by Work Center</title>
  <para>The Work Order buffer status displays provide information on your
  current stock and time buffer levels for those Items having current Work
  Orders. Stock buffers apply to make-to-stock Items; whereas time buffers
  apply to Items which are make-to-order. Keep in mind that buffer status
  information will only be displayed on days when the Constraint Management
  system is run. If you find your displays show no information, this probably
  means Constraint Management has not been run.</para>
  <para>To view Work Order Operation buffer statuses by Work Center, select
  the "W/O Buffer Status by Work Center" option. The following screen will
  appear:</para>

  <note>
    <para>When the buffer status for an Item hits 66 or higher, the status
    number will become red. By highlighting Items which are "red hot," the
    system is informing you which Items should be acted on immediately. The
    best remedy for red hot Item Sites is to expedite any associated Work
    Orders or Purchase Orders.</para>
