  <para>The system support for multi-currency begins with the definition of
  multiple Currencies. In fact, the way to turn on multi-currency support is
  to define two or more Currencies on the master list of Currencies. Once two
  Currencies are defined, you will see multi-currency support integrated
  throughout the application. If you prefer not to use multi-currency at your
  site, then simply define a base Currency only&mdash;and no secondary
  Currencies.</para>
  <caution>
    <para>You must define a base Currency, even if you do not plan to use
    multi-currency. System administrators must ensure that a base Currency is
    defined&mdash;and that it is defined accurately.</para>
  </caution>
  <para>The base Currency is the Currency used for all General Ledger (G/L)
  transactions. Only one base Currency may be defined per each database. Any
  transactions conducted in a foreign Currency will be converted automatically
  to the base Currency (using the prevailing Exchange Rate) before they are
  posted to the G/L.</para>
  <warning>
    <para>Once you post a transaction using multi-currency support, you cannot
    turn off multi-currency from that point forward. Either you implement
    multi-currency or you don"t. There is no middle ground. System-level
    privileges are available to prevent users from accessing Currency and
    Exchange Rate functionality.</para>
  </warning>
  <para>To access the master list of Currencies, select the "Currencies"
  option. The following screen will appear:</para>
