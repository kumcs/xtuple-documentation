    <para>The printed status for a Sales Order at Shipping may be either "No,"
    "Yes," or "Dirty." The first two options indicate whether Shipping Forms
    have been printed for the Order or not. The Dirty status indicates
    Shipping contents have changed since Shipping Forms were printed for the
    Order.</para>
