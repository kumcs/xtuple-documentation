      <term>All Sites</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Select to maintain shipping contents for all sites.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Specify site whose shipping contents you want to
        maintain.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Stock at Shipping</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Display lists stock at shipping based on the specified
        parameters. This display is a nested list, with a plus ("+") sign
        located to the far left of the display next to each line that may be
        expanded to lower levels. By clicking your mouse on a plus sign, you
        reveal lower levels of information related to the documents.</para>

        <note>
          <para>The printed status for a sales order at shipping may be either
          <guilabel>No</guilabel>, <guilabel>Yes</guilabel>, or
          <guilabel>Dirty</guilabel>. The first two options indicate whether
          shipping forms have been printed for the order or not. The
          <guilabel>Dirty</guilabel> status indicates shipping contents have
          changed since shipping forms were printed for the order.</para>
