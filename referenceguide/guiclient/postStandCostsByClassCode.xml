  <para>Posting Standard Costs is <emphasis>not</emphasis> the same process as
  updating Actual Costs or posting Actual Costs to Standard. It is an entirely
  different process—and in most cases, it will only be used in rare
  circumstances.</para>
  <para>Standard Costs are the Costs which are recorded in the General Ledger
  whenever transactions are posted. As such, they are the Costs of record.
  Typically, a company will update its Standard Costs on a periodic basis—for
  example, annually or quarterly. However, if you introduce new products into
  production between Standard Cost updates, you may want to roll up existing
  Standard Costs into the cost of your new manufactured Items.</para>
  <tip>
    <para>For best performance and results, you should run this utility by all
    Class Codes―and don't select the "Roll Up" option. This will ensure your
    Costs are updated properly for any Items which cross Class Code
    lines.</para>
  </tip>
  <para>To update Standard Costs by Class Code, select the "Update Standard
  Costs by Class Code" option. The following screen will appear:</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Select this option if you are updating a selected Class Code or
        Class Code pattern. Do not use this option if you are updating by all
        Class Codes, since that is redundant and can hurt performance. When
        this option is specified, all selected Costs will be added together to
        establish a revised total Standard Cost for the Item. This revised
        total goes into effect after the UPDATE button is selected. If all
        Costs are selected, all Costs will be rolled up. If a subset of all
        Costs is selected, only the subset will be rolled up. If the Roll Up
        Standard Costs option is not specified, the selected Cost updates will
        not be valid above their current level.</para>
