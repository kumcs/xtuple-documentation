        <para>Enter the customer number of the customer whose statement you
        want to print. The lookup feature located to the right of the field
        leads to a searchable customers list. You may also access this list
        using the keyboard shortcut <guibutton>CTRL + L</guibutton> . Once a
        customer number is entered, the customer name and billing address will
        display. Select the <guibutton>?</guibutton> or
        <guibutton>$</guibutton> symbol to view customer information for the
        specified customer. If a customer's credit is good, the button will
        feature a black question mark (<guibutton>?</guibutton>) icon. If the
        customer is on credit warning, the icon will turn into an orange
        dollar sign (<guibutton>$</guibutton>). A red dollar sign
        (<guibutton>$</guibutton>) indicates the customer is on credit
        hold.</para>
