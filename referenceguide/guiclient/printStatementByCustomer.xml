  <para>When printing a Customer Statement, you are presented with the
  following options:</para>
  <para role="xtconnect"><note>

      encounter an EDI processing interface when printing the Customer
      Statement.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the Customer Number of the Customer whose Statement you
        want to print. The lookup feature located to the right of the field
        leads to a searchable Customers list. You may also access this list
        using the keyboard shortcut "CTRL + L". Once a Customer Number is
        entered, the Customer name and billing address will display. Select
        the "?" or "$" symbol to view Customer information for the specified
        Customer. If a Customer's credit is "In Good Standing," the button
        will feature a black question mark ("?") icon. If the icon turns to an
        orange dollar sign ("$"), the Customer's credit Status is "On Credit
        Warning." A red dollar sign ("$") indicates the Customer's credit
        Status is "On Credit Hold."</para>
