    <para>A Sales Order Pick List will be printed if the Sales Order does not
    yet have a Shipment Number associated with it&mdash;that is, if no Line
    Item quantity has been issued to shipping. If stock has been issued to
    Shipping, then the Packing List report definition will be used. Report
    definitions (i.e., Forms) are assigned by Customer Type.</para>
