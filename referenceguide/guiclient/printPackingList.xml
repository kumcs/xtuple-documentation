  <para>To print a Packing List or Sales Order Pick List, select the
  "Print Packing List" option. If the order has a Shipment Number, the Packing
  List form should be used. If there is no Shipment Number&mdash;that is, if
  no Line Item quantity has been issued to shipping&mdash;then the Sales Order Pick
  List form should be used. Both forms are defined under <guimenuitem>Sales
  &gt; Master Information &gt; Customer Form Assignments</guimenuitem>.</para>

  <para>When printing a Packing List, you are presented with the following
  options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Form</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify which type of Packing List form you want to
        print:</para>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>Auto Select</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>Select to have the system automatically determine which
              form should be used, based on the state of the Order at the time
              the report is printed.</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>Packing List</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>Select to have the defined Packing List form printed. This
              form is used if an Order has a Shipment Number.</para>

          <varlistentry>

            <listitem>

      <term>Reprint</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select this option if you want to print a Packing List which has
        already been printed. Once a Packing List has been printed, you must
        use this option if you want to print it again.</para>
        <note>
          <para>A Sales Order Pick List will be printed if the Sales Order
          does not yet have a Shipment Number associated with it&mdash;that
          is, if no Line Item quantity has been issued to shipping. If stock
          has been issued to Shipping, then the Packing List report definition
          will be used.</para>
          <para>The system includes two alternate Sales Order Pick List report
          definitions:</para>
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>PickingListSOClosedLines.xml</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>PickingListNoClosedLines.xml</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
          <para>The first includes already closed Sales Order Line Items in
          the report; the other excludes closed Line Items.</para>

      <term>Shipment #</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the Shipment Number you want to print a Packing List
        for. Shipment Numbers are assigned to Orders when Line Item quantity
        is issued to Shipping. A single Order may have multiple Shipments
        associated with it. If no stock has ever been issued to Shipping for
        an Order, then no Shipment Number will be associated with it.</para>
