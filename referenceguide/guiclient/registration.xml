  <para>Users of the commercial editions of xTuple ERP are required to enter a
  license key to verify their registration of the software. This requirement
  does not apply to users of the PostBooks edition. To register your
  commercial installation, select the "Registration" option. The following
  screen will appear:</para>

  <para>When registering your commercial installation, you are presented with
  the following options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Registration Key</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the license key you received from xTuple&mdash;or from
        your authorized xTuple solution provider. Once a valid key has been
        entered, the following information will be displayed:</para>
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>Customer</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>Displays the name of your company.</para>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>Expiration Date</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>Displays the date when your registration expires. Expired
              registration keys can be renewed for another term either by
              contacting xTuple or your authorized xTuple solution
              provider.</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>Max Concurrent Users</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>Displays the maximum number of concurrent xTuple ERP users
              you are permitted to have, as per the terms of your xTuple ERP
              license agreement. If you are exceeding your maximum number of
              allowed concurrent xTuple ERP users, you should arrange to
              update your license agreement either by contacting xTuple or
              your authorized xTuple solution provider. Keep in mind that
              concurrent connections made by xTuple tools such as xTuple
              Connect, the Updater, CSVimp, and others count toward your
              maximum concurrent users total. The license manager does provide
              for non-xTuple ERP connections (e.g., pgAdmin, third-party
              software tools, etc.). These non-xTuple ERP connections are
              counted separately. You are allowed as many non-xTuple ERP
              connections as you are allowed concurrent xTuple ERP
              connections. For example, if you are registered for 15 xTuple
              ERP users, you may also have 15 concurrent non-xTuple ERP
              connections to the xTuple ERP Database. To get an accurate view
              of all your current connections, use the following menu path
              from the graphical xTuple Desktop: <guimenu>Window &gt; Desktop
              &gt; Users Online</guimenu>.</para>
