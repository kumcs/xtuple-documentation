  <para>The Event Manager enables users to view and manage their received
  Event notifications. Those users granted the System module privilege
  "ViewOtherEvents" may also view Event notifications sent to other users.
  Typically, the "ViewOtherEvents" privilege is assigned to managers with
  responsibility for monitoring the activities of other users. If not granted
  this privilege, users may only view Event notifications associated with
  their own account. Additional System module privileges grant the ability to
  delete one's own Event notifications and/or the Event notifications assigned
  to other users.</para>
  <tip>
    <para>Consider defining a clear relationship between the Events assigned
    to a user and the activities a user participates in. For example, if a
    user is not part of the Sales team, turn off all Sales Events for that
    user.</para>

  <para>The following screen will appear when you select the "Event Manager"
  option:</para>
