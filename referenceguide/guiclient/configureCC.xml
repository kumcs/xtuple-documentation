  <para>The system supports several Credit Card verification services,
  including YourPay, Authorize.Net, and CyberSource. The recording of Credit
  Card transactions is also supported, even if an approved verification
  service is not being used. To configure your system to process Credit Cards,
  select the "Credit Card" option. The following screen will appear:</para>

  <para>When establishing the general settings for your Credit Card
  configuration, you are presented with the following options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Accept Credit Cards</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to indicate the system is configured to accept Credit
        Card Payments. If selected, the Credit Card processing functionality
        will be enabled throughout the system. For example, users will be able
        to store Customer Credit Card information on the Customer master—and
        receive Credit Card payments when processing Sales Orders. If this
        option is not selected, Credit Card functionality will be
        disabled.</para>

    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Work in Test Mode</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select if your site is testing the Credit Card configuration and
        functionality. If selected, the system will verify that the server
        specified under the "Server" tab is in fact the correct test server.
        If this option is not selected, the system will verify that the
        correct production server is specified.</para>
        <warning>
          <para>Make sure that you <emphasis>uncheck</emphasis> this option as
          soon as you are ready to put the application into production. Most
          credit card transactions will appear to succeed whether running in
          test mode or live mode but there will be no actual charges made if
          in test mode.</para>
          <para>If you are using Authorize.Net then you should also make sure
          that the Merchant Interface is configured to run in live mode
          instead of test mode. Both xTuple ERP and the Authorize.Net gateway
          allow sending test transactions to the live server but both
          applications must be set to run in live mode for real transactions
          to occur.</para>

  <para>Fraud detection methods vary depending on the payment gateway used.
  Authorize.Net requires fraud settings to be configured on the gateway
  server. Other services, like YourPay, send fraud detection results back to
  the client software and require the client to decide whether to accept the
  transaction or void it. To configure client-side fraud detections settings,
  if required, select the "Fraud Detection" tab. The following screen will
  appear:</para>

    <para>Some payment gateways, such as Authorize.Net, allow testing against

        <para>Authorize.Net supports three different versions of the
        communications protocol at this time, with the potential for more to
        be added in the future. The xTuple application builds transaction
        requests which conform to version 3.1 of the Authorize.Net protocol.

      <term>Delimiting Character</term>

        <para>This field allows overriding the default character used by
        Authorize.Net to separate parts of the messages sent by the gateway to
        the client application. If this field is blank then Authorize.Net will
        use the comma (,) to separate message fields. If you expect your data
        to contain commas as part of their content, such as street addresses,
        then you should change the Delimiting Character.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Encapsulating Character</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>This field allows setting the character used by Authorize.Net to
        enclose individual parts of the messages sent by the gateway to the
        client application. If this field is blank then Authorize.Net will not
        use any character for this purpose.</para>
        <warning>
          <para>You should set the Encapsulating Character to a value.
          Otherwise some transactions may fail with an error reporting that
          the response from the payment gateway has the wrong number of
          fields.</para>
          <para>Several of these configuration options may be set through the
          Authorize.Net Merchant Interface. If you set any of these options
          there, you <emphasis>must</emphasis> use exactly the same values
          here in the Service Options tab. If you do not then most or all of
          your credit card transactions will fail, often with mysterious
          errors.</para>
          <para>If you want to use the MD5 Hash feature, you must set it to
          exactly the same value here and on the Merchant Interface, including
          spaces and capitalization.</para>
          <para>You may set the Delimiting Character, Encapsulating Character,
          Duplicate Window, and Currency of Transactions in the xTuple

      <term>Duplicate Window</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Use this field to indicate a time window to Authorize.Net for
        checking for duplicate transactions. If similar transactions are sent
        to Authorize.Net within this window then it may reject them as
        duplicates. This is a value in seconds.</para>

      <term>MD5 Hash</term>

        <para>If you want an additional sense of security, set the MD5 Hash
        field to a short string and set the same value on the Merchant
        Interface. This shared secret can be used to assure that the payment
        gateway is actually Authorize.Net's server and not an imposter. The
        value of the MD5 Hash field and a few other fields in the transaction
        request are processed with the MD5 algorithm by the payment gateway
        and the resulting string is returned to the xTuple application. The
        xTuple application performs the same processing and compares the
        result with the value sent by the payment gateway.</para>
