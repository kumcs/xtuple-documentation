        <para>Specify the reason for the Return Authorization. Reason codes

      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the Item Number of the Item you want to authorize. The
        Items you may select will vary depending on the Line Item disposition.
        For example, only Job Items may be selected for Line Items having the
        Service disposition. Once an Item Number is entered, the Inventory
        Unit of Measure and Item description will automatically appear.</para>
        <para>If a returned Item is an Average-Cost Item, is linked to a Sales
        Order, and will result in an Inventory receipt, the Average Cost for
        the Item on the Sales Order will be pulled into the return Line Item
        as the default value. If there is no Sales Order to reference, the
        cost on the receipt will default to the Standard Cost for the Item. If
        the Item Site is Average Cost, the Unit Cost will actually be editable
        on the return Line Item, so you can manually or programmatically
        change the value to whatever makes sense for your business
        practice.</para>

              Schedule Assignment or B) any Sale in effect at the time of

              which matches the selected UOM will be chosen―that is, as long
              as the quantity break does not exceed the quantity being priced.
              If no entry matches the UOM with a quantity break less than the
              quantity being priced, then the lowest value Price for any UOM
              will be chosen. To make sure a specific UOM is always chosen at
              the desired level of Price specificity, then your Pricing
              Schedules should include at least one UOM with a quantity break
              of 0.</para>
