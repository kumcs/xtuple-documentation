        <para>Line item dispositions are defaulted conditionally based on the

            <listitem>
              <para>Select to authorize the servicing of an item for the
              specified quantity. This disposition is valid only for Job
              items. Price controls will be disabled for this disposition. A
              new sales order with linked work order(s) will be created to
              track work and shipping on the repair or service. The billing
              for service or repair work should be handled on the new sales
              order. Service or repair items should first be received by the
              Return Authorization. If the Job item is Lot/Serial controlled,
              you will be prompted to assign Lot/Serial numbers when the
              receipt is posted. This assignment of Lot/Serial Numbers can be
              simplified if you link authorized line items with existing
              Lot/Serial Numbers at the line item level. For more information,
              please see <xref linkend="returnAuthItemLotSerial"/>.</para>

              a new sales order. The Price controls will be disabled for this
              disposition. A new corresponding sales order and line will be
              created if one does not already exist. The billing should be
              handled on the new sales order. When there are line items on the
              Return Authorization having the disposition "Ship" and the
              timing is "Upon Receipt," then all the "Ship" disposition line
              items will be created on the new sales order at the same time—at
              the moment when the return is first received.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the reason for the Return Authorization. Reason codes
        are used to explain why a Customer return is being authorized. The
        line item inherits the Reason Code from the header, but may be

      <term>Item Number</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the item number of the item you want to authorize. The
        items you may select will vary depending on the line item disposition.
        For example, only Job items may be selected for line items having the
        Service disposition. Once an item number is entered, the inventory
        Unit of Measure and item description will automatically appear.</para>

        <para>If a returned item is an Average-Cost item, is linked to a sales
        order, and will result in an inventory receipt, the Average Cost for
        the item on the sales order will be pulled into the return line item
        as the default value. If there is no sales order to reference, the
        cost on the receipt will default to the Standard Cost for the item. If
        the item site is Average Cost, the Unit Cost will actually be editable
        on the return line item, so you can manually or programmatically
        change the value to whatever makes sense for your business
        practice.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Displays the Customer Part Number (i.e., item Alias) that
        corresponds to the item number entered in the Item Number field. The
        Customer Part Number will display only if you enter an item Alias in
        the Item Number field?or if an Alias was used on the original sales
        order. To enter an item Alias, place the cursor in the Item Number
        field and then use the keyboard shortcut "CTRL + A". After you have
        entered a valid item Alias, hit the TAB key. A list of items that use
        the specified item Alias will be displayed. Select the desired item
        from the list. The item Alias will display as the Customer Part
        Number. Item Aliases are defined on the Item master.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>Displays the Net Unit Price for the sales order item. This

              Authorizations linked to an original sales order if header
              disposition was Credit or Return when the order was imported. If
              there is no linked sales order, then the system will choose the
              lower of the following two Prices: A) The most-specific Pricing
              Schedule Assignment or B) any Sale in effect at the time of
              order entry. The specificity of Pricing Schedule Assignments is
              determined in the following descending order: By Customer
              Ship-To Address (most specific), by Customer, by Customer Type,
              by Customer Type pattern, by all Customers. The lookup feature

              (UOM) on it (or if several Pricing Schedules share the same
              level of Price specificity, but they have different UOMs) then
              the UOM which matches the selected UOM will be chosen—that is,
              as long as the quantity break does not exceed the quantity being
              priced. If no entry matches the UOM with a quantity break less
              than the quantity being priced, then the lowest value Price for
              any UOM will be chosen. To make sure a specific UOM is always
              chosen at the desired level of Price specificity, then your
              Pricing Schedules should include at least one UOM with a
              quantity break of 0.</para>

              which matches the selected UOM will be chosen—that is, as long
              as the quantity break does not exceed the quantity being priced.
              If no entry matches the UOM with a quantity break less than the
              quantity being priced, then the lowest value Price for any UOM
              will be chosen. To make sure a specific UOM is always chosen at
              the desired level of Price specificity, then your Pricing
              Schedules should include at least one UOM with a quantity break
              of 0.</para>
