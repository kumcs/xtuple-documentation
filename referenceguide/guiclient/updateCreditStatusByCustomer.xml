  Orders can be created for that Customer. For example, Customers whose credit
  status is either "On Credit Warning" or "On Credit Hold" may not have Sales
  Orders entered for them. To update a Customer's credit status, select the
  "Update Credit Status by Customer" option. The following screen will
