  <para>A Pricing Schedule is a grouping of sold Items indicating special
  Prices for specified Quantity Breaks. Pricing Schedules may be assigned to
  individual Customers or to groups of Customers by Customer Type. To access
  the master list of Pricing Schedules, select the "Pricing Schedules" option.
  The following screen will appear:</para>

  <para>At the top of the screen is a "Search for" field. To search for a
  Pricing Schedule, begin typing in the search field. As you type, the list
  will automatically scroll toward the Pricing Schedule you are typing. You
  can also search for Pricing Schedules manually by scrolling through the
  list. The following filters can also be applied to your search:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Show Expired Pricing Schedules</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to display expired Pricing Schedules.</para>
        <note>
          <para>The effectivity and expiration dates for Pricing Schedules
          correspond to the created date for Sales Orders. Changes to Line
          Item quantities or scheduled dates for already-created Sales Orders
          can also cause Pricing Schedule effectivity to be recalculated as of
          the date the changes occur.</para>
