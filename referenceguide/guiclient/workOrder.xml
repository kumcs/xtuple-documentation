  <para>Work Orders define requirements for the production of manufactured
  items. You may also create Work Orders for purchased items that you normally
  purchase, but you occasionally manufacture. These items may have a Bill of
  materials (BOM)—or not. The system supports both BOM-based and non-BOM-based
  Work Orders.</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>BOM-based</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Material requirements are drawn from the bill of materials when
        the Work Order is exploded, using the specified Revision. Users may
        add or subtract material requirements as needed.</para>

      <term>Non-BOM-based</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Ideal for labor-only Work Orders having a routing
        but no BOM—for example, service work orders which require labor
        operations only. Also good for items or Jobs where the material
        requirements are not-known—but must be added on an ad-hoc
        basis.</para>

  <para>To create a new Work Order, select the "Create New Work Order" option.

          Order using the Work Order screen. Similarly, production posting for
          Job items occurs in a unique way. Production for Job item Work
          Orders is posted when the sales order which demanded the Job item is
          issued to shipping. This is the only way to post production for Job
          item Work Orders.</para>
