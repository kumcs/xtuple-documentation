  <para>Work orders define requirements for the production of manufactured
  items. You may also create work orders for purchased items that you normally
  purchase, but you occasionally manufacture. These items may have a bill of
  materials (BOM)—or not. The system supports both BOM-based and non-BOM-based
  work orders.</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>BOM-based</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Material requirements are drawn from the BOMs when the work
        order is exploded, using the specified revision. Users may add or
        subtract material requirements as needed.</para>

    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Non-BOM-based</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Ideal for labor-only work orders having a routing but no BOM—for
        example, service work orders which require labor operations only. Also
        good for items or jobs where the material requirements are
        not-known—but must be added on an <emphasis>ad hoc</emphasis>
        basis.</para>

        and buy items.</para>

            </indexterm>Work orders for job items are created exclusively by
          sales order demand. It is not possible to create a job item work
          order using the Work Order screen. Similarly, production posting for
          job items occurs in a unique way. Production for job item work
          orders is posted when the sales order, which demanded the job item,
          is issued to shipping. This is the only way to post production for
          job item work orders.</para>
