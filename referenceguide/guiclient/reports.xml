    <para>The stock xTuple ERP reports are written using Arial and Helvetica
    fonts. We chose these fonts to try and prevent unpredictable behavior
    caused when xTuple reports are printed on different operating systems. Of
    course, you are free to use other fonts when writing report definitions
    for your own environment.</para>
  </note>
  <para>The report definitions master list displays information on all stored
  reports, including report name, report grade, and report description.</para>
  <tip>
    <para>Stock reports are given a grade of zero ("0"). These stock reports
    may be updated during database upgrades. You should assign a grade greater
    than zero to any custom reports to distinguish them from stock reports.
    Doing so will ensure your custom reports are not overwritten during
    upgrades. A report definition may have multiple grades. By default, the
    application uses the report definition with the highest grade.</para>
