  <para>The Approved Payments screen displays information on all existing
  selected payments, including bank account to be paid from, vendor name,
  document type, document number, invoice number, purchase order number,
  amount selected for payment, and running total.</para>

  <tip>
    <para>Vendors can be filtered by type and there is an option to select all
    bank accounts or a specific bank account.</para>

  <para>The following buttons are unique to this screen:</para>

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term><guibutton>CLEAR APPROVAL</guibutton></term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Highlight an approved payment and then select this button to
        clear the approval. Because an item that has been cleared is no longer
        approved for payment, this option removes the item from the master
        list of approved payments.</para>
