  <title>Global Conversion Ratio</title>
  <para>Global conversion ratios enable you to create basic inventory
  conversions, such as inches to feet, pounds to ounces, etc. Once defined
  here, these conversions may be used wherever item conversions are usedâ€”for
  example, when creating product definitions, entering sales orders or Bills
  of materials, etc. Global conversions, which have the label
  <literal>Global</literal> appended to them, can also be transferred to item
  records "on the fly." When you select a global conversion ratio (e.g., at
  sales order entry), you will have the option to add the conversion
  permanently to the item record.</para>
  <para>The master list of global conversion ratios should include conversions
  both from and to the specified unit of measure (UOM). That is to say, if the
  conversion from ounces to pounds is defined in the maintenance for pounds,
  the calculated conversion from pounds to ounces should also appear in the
  ounces maintenance. Users can add, edit and delete from the list of
  conversions. However, users should be discouraged from editing or changing a
  conversion ratio that is being or has been used in a transaction.</para>
  <para>To create a new global conversion ratio, select the <guibutton>NEW</guibutton> button. The
  following screen will appear:</para>

    <para>As their name implies, global conversion ratios may be used
    throughout the system once they are defined in the UOM Master
    Information.</para>
