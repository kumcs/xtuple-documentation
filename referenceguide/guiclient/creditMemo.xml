        Sales Credit to, using the lookup feature located to the right of the
        field. The list will include Invoices for the specified Customer. If a
        Sales Credit is applied to a specific Invoice, the Sales Credit may
        only credit Items which appeared on the chosen Invoice. If for some
        reason the Sales Credit is applied to a closed Invoice, the Sales

        posting of a Sales Credit, de-select this option.</para>

        using the keyboard shortcut "CTRL + L". Once a Customer Number is
        entered, the Customer name and billing address will display. Select
        the "?" or "$" symbol to view Customer information for the specified
        Customer. If a Customer's credit is "In Good Standing," the button
        will feature a black question mark ("?") icon. If the icon turns to an
        orange dollar sign ("$"), the Customer's credit Status is "On Credit

        Status is "On Credit Hold."</para>
