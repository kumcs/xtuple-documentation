        <para>Specify the invoice number of the invoice you want to apply the
        sales credit to, using the lookup feature located to the right of the
        field. The list will include invoices for the specified customer. If a
        sales credit is applied to a specific invoice, the sales credit may
        only credit items which appeared on the chosen invoice. If for some
        reason the sales credit is applied to a closed invoice, the sales
        credit will be listed as an unapplied sales credit.</para>

        posting of a sales credit, de-select this option.</para>

        using the keyboard shortcut "CTRL + L". Once a customer Number is
        entered, the customer name and billing address will display. Select
        the "?" or "$" symbol to view customer information for the specified
        customer. If a customer's credit is "In Good Standing," the button
        will feature a black question mark ("?") icon. If the icon turns to an
        orange dollar sign ("$"), the customer's credit Status is "On Credit
