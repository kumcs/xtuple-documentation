  <title>Run Buffer Status by Planner Code</title>

  <para>When you run buffer status by planner code, you are running the
  constraint management system. This utility, when it is run, scans through
  your data and then updates the buffer status for items in the specified
  planner code(s) using the most current information.</para>

  <para>Because buffer status information is time-sensitive, you must run the
  system frequently (i.e., daily) to keep your statuses up-to-date. In fact,
  the various buffer status displays will not even show status information if
  constraint management has not been run on the day when you're trying to view
  buffer status information. This built-in requirement prevents you from using
  information that is not current.</para>

  <note>
    <para>The critical buffer status in the constraint management system is
    66%. In other words, any time you consume 66% of a buffer, then it's time
    to act immediately to resolve the situation. The 66% value is a percentage
    that is widely used in academic research and practical real-world
    implementations of the Theory of Constraints—a theory pioneered by Eliyahu
    Goldratt.</para>
  </note>

  <para>After the buffer status utility has been run, you may view the
  constraint management displays which pertain to the affected items—and then
  decide whether to take immediate action based on the newly-updated status
  values.</para>
