  <para>Workflow is a feature in xTuple that allows you to link activities
  together into dependent sequences (workflows), and to assign activities to
  specific users. For example, you can create workflow for fulfilling sales
  orders. When a new sales order comes into the system, it can generate
  activities for picking and shipping the order, and assign these activities
  to users to perform.</para>
  <para>To set up workflow, go to <guimenuitem>System &gt;
  Setup</guimenuitem><guimenuitem>&gt; Master Information &gt;
