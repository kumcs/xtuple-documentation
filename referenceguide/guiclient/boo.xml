      <listitem>
        <para>If revision control is enabled at your site, specify the routing
        revision number you want to view. If none exists, simply enter a value
        to create one. The status of the revision will also be displayed. The
        following statuses apply to revisions:</para>

        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>Active</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>This is the current, default revision used for costing and
              material requirements planning (MRP). Only one revision can be
              active at the same time. Active revisions may be modified.
              However, once a revision has been deactivated, it may only be
              reactivated if you have enabled the configuration option to
              allow for substitute revisions.</para>

              <tip>
                <para>The active revision becomes inactive when a pending or
                substitute revision is activated. To activate a pending or
                substitute revision, right-click on the magnifying glass next
                to the item number and select
                <guimenuitem>Activate</guimenuitem>. Inactive revisions cannot
                be modified.</para>
              </tip>

          </varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>Pending</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>This is a revision that has never been used, but is under
              development or consideration. You may store multiple pending
              revisions. When a pending revision is entered in the
              <guilabel>Revision</guilabel> field, an option to activate the
              item will dynamically appear in the <guimenu>Context</guimenu>
              menu after you right-click on the magnifying glass next to the
              item number. Select <guilabel>Activate</guilabel> from this
              <guimenu>Context</guimenu> menu to convert a pending revision to
              the active revision.</para>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>Substitute</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>If you have enabled the configuration option to allow for
              substitute revisions, this status will be available. If enabled,
              any active revision will become a substitute revision when it is
              deactivated. Substitute revisions serve as alternate revisions
              which can be activated at a later date.</para>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>Inactive</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>This is a formerly active revision. Inactive revisions
              cannot be modifiedâ€”only viewed. They are stored to provide
              historical, point-in-time build information, which may be used
              for various purposes throughout the application. For example,
              privileged users may select inactive revisions when processing
              work orders or purchase orders. There is no limit to the number
              of inactive revisions you may save.</para>

  <note>
    <para>Once a revision date has been entered, the date field cannot be
    erased. The specific date may be updated to reflect subsequent revisions,
    but the field will never be null as long as the BOMs exists.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Select a final work-in-process (WIP) location. This is an
        optional selection which may be used for tracking the site locations
        of finished goods inventory as it moves through the manufacturing
        process. The feature applies only to top-level, multiple location
        control (MLC) items whose production is posted through work order
        operations posting. If you choose to track finished MLC goods using
        this feature, then the final location is the location where inventory
        will be located when operations posting for the work order is
        completed. If you do not wish to track WIP locations for finished MLC
        goods, then you can ignore this option.</para>

        The production lead time value is equal to the maximum execution day
        value specified for listed operations. Each operation must have an
        execution day specified. Based on values entered for all listed
        operations, whichever execution day value is the maximum, that value
        will be displayed as the production lead time for the routing.</para>
