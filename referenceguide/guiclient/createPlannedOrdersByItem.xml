  <title>Run MRP by Item</title>
  <para>When you run MRP by Item, you are running the Material Requirements
  Planning (MRP) system. This utility creates Planned Replenishment Orders to
  meet existing Sales Order and Work Order demand. Replenishment Orders will
  be created whenever a Planned Availability for an Item Site falls below its
  Reorder Level. The quantity of the Replenishment Order will be enough to
  restore Planned Availability back to the Reorder Level&mdash;or to the Order
  Up To (OUT) Level, if the OUT Level is greater.</para>
  <tip>
    <para>When running MRP by Item for manufactured Items, the system
    generates Planned Work Orders only. If you want to also generate Planned
    Orders for purchased requirements, you should run MRP by Planner Code.
    Only Items designated as MRP Items will be affected by an MRP run.
    Unposted Purchase Orders and Purchase Requests are considered as valid
    sources of supply when MRP is run.</para>
  </tip>
  <para>To run MRP for an individual Item, select the "Run MRP by Item"
  option. The following screen will appear:</para>

  <note>
    <para>The system deletes any non-firmed Planned Orders when MRP is run. If
    demand for the deleted Planned Orders still exists, the Orders will be
    replaced by new Replenishment Orders having new Planned Order Numbers.
    Order quantities will also be updated if demand levels have changed since
    MRP was last run.</para>

  <para>When running MRP by Item, you are presented with the following
  options:</para>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Item Number</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the Item Number of the Item you want to create a Planned
        Order for. The lookup feature located to the right of the field leads
        to a searchable list of make and buy items.</para>

      <term>Cutoff Date</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify how far into the future the MRP run should look for
        demand. If you schedule an MRP or MPS job submitted to the xTuple
        Connect Batch Manager to run on a periodic basis&mdash;daily, weekly,
        monthly&mdash;the cutoff date used for the run will automatically be
        updated by the number of days in the specified reschedule interval
        (Day = +1, Week = +7, and Month = +30).</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Select to perform a multi-level explosion to identify dependent
        demand for the specified Item. This functionality will create Planned
        Orders for any child demand, if necessary. The functionality mirrors
        the same feature available at the Planner Code level, which is
        available when running MRP by Planner Code.</para>

        </indexterm>Delete Existing Firmed MRP Orders</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to delete existing Firmed Orders. A firm Planned Order is
        a Planned Order that has been solidified in the schedule. By default,
        firm Planned Orders are not deleted when MRP is run. Selecting this
        option overrides that default behavior. If firm Planned Orders are
        deleted when MRP is run, they will automatically be replaced by soft
        (i.e., non-firmed) Planned Orders, assuming the demand for the
        requirements still exists.</para>

      <term>Create MRP Exceptions</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>If you are using the MRP Exceptions feature set for planning
        purposes, you should always select this option when running MRP. Not
        only will this option create MRP Exceptions for you&mdash;it will also
        force MRP to recognize those exceptions and adjust its calculations
        when creating Planned Orders. The end result will be Planned Orders
        that are netted against the known exceptions. Planner Code options
        related to exceptions handling may also impact your results. If you do
        not select this option&mdash;and you are using the MRP Exceptions
        feature set&mdash;the netting effect will not be applied and you could
        end up with excess supply orders. Do not select this option if you are
        not using the MRP Exceptions feature set. For more information about
        MRP Exceptions, please see <xref linkend="dspMRPExceptions" />.</para>
