  <para>To create an Invoice, an Order selected for billing must first be
  posted. Once the Order selected for billing is posted, an Invoice for that
  selected Order is created. To post Orders selected for billing in batch
  mode, select the "Post Billing Selections" option. The following screen will
  appear:</para>

  <para>When posting billing selections, you are presented with the following
  options:</para>

      <listitem>

        Types. Refine your search using Regular Expressions.</para>

    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Consolidate by Customer</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to cause all Sales Orders selected for billing for each
        Customer to be consolidated on one Invoice. To be consolidated, the
        Orders must have matching criteria (e.g., Terms, Tax Authority,
        Billing information). If these criteria do not match, then
        non-conforming Orders will not be consolidated. If only a single Order
        exists, at all or in a group, then it will be posted as a single
        Invoice. Consolidated Orders are given a combined header, and the Line
        Items are attached to the Invoice in no particular order. Line Items
        themselves are never consolidated (i.e., you can have two lines for
        the same Item). In addition, Invoice Line Items have a reference back
        to their original Sales Order Item.</para>
