        <para>Select to include the current posted value of the work order in
        the display. The posted value is equal to the total cost accumulated
        on the work order, including both labor and materials. The posted
        value will be the same as the WIP value until the point when finished
        goods are received. Ultimately, once Production (or operations)
        posting is completed, the posted value will be equal to the received
        value. If these two values are different, then a variance will
        result.</para>

        <para>Display lists work order History by item, using the specified
        parameters. The start dates and end dates are color-coded for ease of
        use. Both dates will display in red type if the work order is not yet
        in-process and is also past due. Once a work order's status is changed
        to in-process ("I"), the start date will automatically revert to black
        type.</para>
