        scrap. You may scrap top-level Items after they have been received
        into Inventory&mdash;or before. Keep in mind that if you scrap
        top-level Items prior to receiving them, material requirements for
        those Items may or may not have been issued to the Work Order yet. You
        should make any necessary adjustments to account for those
        requirements. For example, you may need to issue the
        components&mdash;either manually or through a material
        backflush&mdash;and then scrap them retroactively.</para>

    <para>Shop Floor Workbench users should only scrap top-level Items after
    they have posted production sufficient to cover the scrap quantity. For
    example, if a user assembles 10 top-level Items successfully but
    significantly damages the 11th, the user should post a quantity of 11
    produced and then scrap one (i.e., 11 - 1 = 10).</para>
