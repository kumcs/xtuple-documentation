  <para>The Vendor Catalog Costs screen helps you manage your stock Items,
  when using data providers through the External Vendor Catalog. This screen
  displays the underlying data stored in the <literal>catcost</literal> table
  in your xTuple database. If the <literal>catcost</literal> table is
  populated with information and you update your Catalog, the Catalog will
  check the table first. If an Item has been added, then the Item and its
  purchased cost can be managed and updated from here.</para>
  <para>To view and manage your Vendor Catalog Costs, select the "Vendor
  Catalog Costs" option. The following screen will appear.</para>

  <para>The Vendor Catalog Costs screen displays pricing information related
  to Items in your Vendor Catalog. Item Master and Item Source records are
  both displayed here. Setting these records will prevent any costs in the
  Catalog from being updated. To update information for an Item, select the
  "Edit" option from the right-click menu.</para>
  <note>
    <para>If your pricing configuration is configured to "Use Wholesale Price
    for Unit Cost for Markups," then your sales commission is based on the
    Item's Wholesale Price. The <literal>catcost</literal> information can be
    used to manage those costs, as well, reflecting a true cost for
    commissions.</para>
