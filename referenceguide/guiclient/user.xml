        case, the User Account's name will appear with horizontal lines

      <listitem>
        <para>Select to require User Accounts to use enhanced authentication
        when they log in to the application. Enhanced authentication adds a
        layer to the authentication process used to log in to the system. When
        this feature is turned on, User Account passwords are stored in the
        database in a modified form. The end result is that User Accounts may
        only log in to the database using the xTuple Client. If User Accounts
        try to access the database using a tool other than an xTuple
        application, they will not be able to connect. User Account passwords
        entered when logging in via the xTuple Client will not be recognized
        if the xTuple Client is not used. If enhanced authentication is
        specified for a User Account, that User Account must also select the
        "Use Enhanced Authentication" flag in their log in options. If
        enhanced authentication is not specified, User Accounts will be
        permitted to log in to the database using database tools other than
        the xTuple Client.</para>
        <note>
          <para>The enhanced authentication option will only affect User
          Accounts whose passwords are created or updated after the option is
          enabled/disabled. Legacy User Accounts will not be affected if the
          option is not used. Legacy User Accounts may continue logging in as

  <para>Many of the available privileges govern User Accounts' ability to
  either view or edit information. In some cases, however, it may be possible
  to perform editing tasks on screens where only view privileges have been
  granted. Take item sites, for example. Item sites exist as their own objects
  with their own privileges independent of items. When you edit an item site,
  you are not editing the item itself, but an object associated with the item.
  By contrast, when you edit item notes, item transformations, or item
  aliases, you are editing things which belong exclusively and intrinsically
  to item records. On the Item screen, there is an option to view/edit item
  sites for the item. Let's imagine a User Account has privileges to edit item
  sites but to only view items. Following this example, xTuple would allow the
  User Account to edit item sites from the Item record, even when in view
  mode.</para>
