      <listitem>
        <para>Select to mark the user as Active. Not selecting marks the user
        as Inactive. Users cannot be deleted from the system; however, marking
        them Inactive prevents them from logging into the application. In some
        cases, inactive users may still be associated with valid documents in
        the system. Whenever that is the case, the user's name will appear
        with horizontal lines striking through it. Re-saving documents with
        this inactive user relationship may cause the username to be dropped

        individual keystrokes are replaced by asterisks (*) to protect the

      <term>Use Enhanced Authentication</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to require users to use enhanced authentication when they
        log in to the application. Enhanced authentication adds a layer to the
        authentication process used to log in to the system. When this feature
        is turned on, user passwords are stored in the database in a modified
        form. The end result is that users may only log in to the database
        using the xTuple Client. If users try to access the database using a
        tool other than an xTuple application, they will not be able to
        connect. User passwords entered when logging in via the xTuple Client
        will not be recognized if the xTuple Client is not used. If enhanced
        authentication is specified for a user, that user must also select the
        "Use Enhanced Authentication" flag in their log in options. If
        enhanced authentication is not specified, users will be permitted to
        log in to the database using database tools other than the xTuple
        Client.</para>
        <note>
          <para>The enhanced authentication option will only affect users
          whose passwords are created or updated after the option is
          enabled/disabled. Legacy users will not be affected if the option is
          not used. Legacy users may continue logging in as before this
          feature was implemented.</para>

  <para>Many of the available privileges govern users' ability to either view
  or edit information. In some cases, however, it may be possible to perform
  editing tasks on screens where only view privileges have been granted. Take
  Item Sites, for example. Item Sites exist as their own objects with their
  own privileges independent of Items. When you edit an Item Site, you are not
  editing the Item itself, but an object associated with the Item. By
  contrast, when you edit Item notes, Item transformations, or Item aliases,
  you are editing things which belong exclusively and intrinsically to Item
  records. On the Item screen, there is an option to view/edit Item Sites for
  the Item. Let's imagine a user has privileges to edit Item Sites but to only
  view Items. Following this example, xTuple would allow the user to edit Item
  Sites from the Item record, even when in view mode.</para>
  <para>Here are some examples of independent objects which may be editable
  from a parent window, even in view mode:</para>
