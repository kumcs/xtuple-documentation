  <para>Posting standard costs is <emphasis>not</emphasis> the same process as
  updating actual costs or posting actual costs to Standard. It is an entirely
  different process&mdash;and in most cases, it will only be used in rare
  circumstances.</para>
  <para>Standard costs are the costs which are recorded in the General Ledger
  whenever transactions are posted. As such, they are the costs of record.
  Typically, a company will update its standard costs on a periodic
  basis&mdash;for example, annually or quarterly. However, if you introduce
  new products into production between standard cost updates, you may want to
  roll up existing standard costs into the cost of your new manufactured
  items.</para>
  <tip>
    <para>Cost roll ups in xTuple are performed from the bottom up. In other
    words, to update the costs for a parent item you need to roll the costs
    for all the child items up into the parent item. For this reason, posting
    costs by class code is the generally preferred method. That way you can
    guarantee all the required costs are posted&mdash;and none are
    missed.</para>
  </tip>
  <para>To update standard costs individually by item, select the "Update
  Standard Costs by Item" option. The following screen will appear:</para>

  <note>
    <para>Updating standard costs has absolutely no impact on an item's actual
    costs. The only costs affected will be standard costs.</para>

  <para>When updating standard costs by item, you are presented with the
  following options:</para>
  <variablelist>

      <listitem>
        <para>Select to roll up standard costs. When this option is specified,
        all selected costs will be added together to establish a revised total
        standard cost for the item. This revised total goes into effect after
        the UPDATE button is selected. If all costs are selected, all costs
        will be rolled up. If a subset of all costs is selected, only the
        subset will be rolled up. If the Roll Up Standard Costs option is not
        specified, the selected cost updates will not be valid above their
        current level.</para>
