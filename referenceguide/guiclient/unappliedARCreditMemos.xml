  <para>Whenever a Credit Memo amount has not been applied to a specific
  Invoice or Debit Memo&mdash;either in whole or in part&mdash;that Credit
  Memo will appear on the list of unapplied Credit Memos. Both miscellaneous
  Receivables Credit Memos and unapplied Credit Memos generated from the Billing
  section may appear on the list.</para>
  <note>
    <para>A newly-entered miscellaneous Credit Memo is an unapplied Credit
    Memo by default. However, Credit Memos generated from the Billing section
    may or may not be unapplied&mdash;depending on circumstances. For example,
    if a Sales Order Credit Memo is applied to a specific Invoice when the Credit
    Memo is created, then that Credit Memo is applied and will not appear on
    the list of unapplied Credit Memos. However, if a Sales Order Credit Memo is not
    applied when it is created, it will subsequently appear on the unapplied
    list.</para>
  </note>
  <para>To access the master list of unapplied Credit Memos, select the "List
  Unapplied Credit Memos" option. The following screen will appear:</para>
