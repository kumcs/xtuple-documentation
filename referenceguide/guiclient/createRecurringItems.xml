    </indexterm>Create Recurring Items</title>
  <para>Several document types may be marked as recurring: invoices,
  incidents, to-do items, and projects. Recurring means these documents have
  the capacity to be recreated over and over again on a periodic basis. To
  process recurring documents, you need to run the recurring items utility.
  When the utility is run, copies will be created of any documents marked as
  recurring. The frequency of the recurrence is defined on the parent document
  itself.</para>
  <tip>
    <para>Once the recurring flag is set on a parent document, all subsequent
    copies will be marked in the database as children of the original parent
    document. If you need to make changes to the frequency of a recurring
    document, you must go back to the original parent document and make the
    changes there. Frequency changes made at the parent level will propagate
    to the child level.</para>
  </tip>
  <para>To create recurring items, select the "Create Recurring Items" option.

      <listitem>
        <para>Select to create recurring invoices for any invoices marked as
        recurring. The frequency of the recurrence is defined on the parent
        invoice. When the utility is run, new unposted invoices are created
        for any recurring invoices having an invoice date within the specified
        number of look-ahead days. The look ahead days, or buffer days, are
        specified in the <guimenu>Accounting</guimenu> module configuration. You can read more
        about recurring invoice buffer days here <xref

      <term>Vouchers</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to create recurring vouchers for any miscellaneous
        vouchers marked as recurring. The frequency of the recurrence is
        defined on the parent voucher. When the utility is run, new unposted
        vouchers are created for any recurring vouchers having a voucher date
        within the specified number of look-ahead days. The look ahead days,
        or buffer days, are specified in the <guimenu>Accounting</guimenu> module configuration.
