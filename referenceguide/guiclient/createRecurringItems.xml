    </indexterm>Create Recurring Items</title>
  <para>Several document types may be marked as recurring: Invoices,
  Incidents, To-Do Items, and Projects. Recurring means these documents have
  the capacity to be recreated over and over again on a periodic basis. To
  process recurring documents, you need to run the recurring items utility.
  When the utility is run, copies will be created of any documents marked as
  recurring. The frequency of the recurrence is defined on the parent document
  itself.</para>
  <tip>
    <para>Once the recurring flag is set on a parent document, all subsequent
    copies will be marked in the database as children of the original parent
    document. If you need to make changes to the frequency of a recurring
    document, you must go back to the original parent document and make the
    changes there. Frequency changes made at the parent level will propagate
    to the child level.</para>
  </tip>
  <para>To create recurring items, select the "Create Recurring Items" option.
  The following screen will appear:</para>

  <para>When creating recurring items, you are presented with the following
  options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Invoices</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to create recurring Invoices for any Invoices marked as
        recurring. The frequency of the recurrence is defined at the parent
        level. Newly-created recurring Invoices will appear on the list of
        recurring Invoices. Their distribution date will depend on the
        frequency specified and the Invoice date on the original Invoice. For
        example, if the original Invoice is dated January 1 and the frequency
        is once every month, then the next Invoices will be dated February 1,
        March 1, etc.</para>
        <tip>
          <para>Once the recurring flag is set on the original Invoice, all
          subsequent, recurring Invoices will be marked in the database as
          children of the original parent Invoice. If you need to make changes
          to the frequency of a recurring Invoice (or to cancel the recurring
          Invoice), you must go back to the original parent Invoice and make
          the changes there.</para>
