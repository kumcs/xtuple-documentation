    </indexterm>Create Recurring Items</title>
  <para>Several document types may be marked as recurring: Invoices,
  Incidents, To-Do Items, and Projects. Recurring means these documents have
  the capacity to be recreated over and over again on a periodic basis. To
  process recurring documents, you need to run the recurring items utility.
  When the utility is run, copies will be created of any documents marked as
  recurring. The frequency of the recurrence is defined on the parent document
  itself.</para>
  <tip>
    <para>Once the recurring flag is set on a parent document, all subsequent
    copies will be marked in the database as children of the original parent
    document. If you need to make changes to the frequency of a recurring
    document, you must go back to the original parent document and make the
    changes there. Frequency changes made at the parent level will propagate
    to the child level.</para>
  </tip>
  <para>To create recurring items, select the "Create Recurring Items" option.

        number of look-ahead days. The look ahead days, or buffer days, are
        specified in the Accounting Module configuration. You can read more
