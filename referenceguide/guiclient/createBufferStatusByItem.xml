  <title>Run Buffer Status by Item</title>
  <para>When you run buffer status by Item, you are running the Constraint
  Management system. This utility, when it is run, scans through your data and
  then updates the buffer status for the specified Item using the most current
  information. Because buffer status information is time-sensitive, you must
  run the system frequently (i.e., daily) to keep your statuses up-to-date. In
  fact, the various buffer status displays will not even show status
  information if Constraint Management has not been run on the day when you"re
  trying to view buffer status information. This built-in requirement prevents
  you from using information that is not current.</para>
  <note>
    <para>The critical buffer status in the Constraint Management system is
    66%. In other words, any time you consume 66% of a buffer, then it\qs time
    to act immediately to resolve the situation. The 66% value is a percentage
    that is widely used in academic research and practical real-world
    implementations of the Theory of Constraints&mdash;a theory pioneered by
    Eliyahu Goldratt.</para>
  </note>
  <para>After the buffer status utility has been run, you may view the
  Constraint Management displays which pertain to the Item&mdash;and then
  decide whether to take immediate action based on the newly-updated status
  value.</para>
  <para>To run buffer status by Item, select the "Run Buffer Status by Item"
  option. The following screen will appear:</para>
