        Shipping Form.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

  <tip>
    <para>In the case where you have multiple versions (i.e., grades) of the
    same-named report definition, it doesn't matter which one you select when
    setting up a Form. The system will always use the report definition having
    the highest grade.</para>
