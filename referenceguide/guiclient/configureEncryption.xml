  <para>You must have an encryption key defined to successfully process credit
  card and electronic funds transfer (EFT) transactions in xTuple ERP.</para>
  <caution>
    <para>It is very important that you keep a backup copy of your encryption
    key in a safe location. If you lose your encryption key and do not have a
    backup copy, you risk losing access to your encrypted data.</para>
  </caution>
  <para>To define the name of the encryption key and its location in your
  system, go to <guimenuitem>System &gt; Setup</guimenuitem><guimenuitem> &gt;
  Configure &gt; Encryption</guimenuitem>. The following screen will
  appear:</para>

  <tip>
    <para>All users on your system who need access to credit card and EFT
    information must use the same key file. The key file can be a simple text
    file with any contents whatsoever. It should be stored at the same level
    as the xTuple executable file. For Mac users, this would be within the
    MacOS directory inside the package contents for your xTuple executable.
    The key file is not stored in the database.</para>
  </tip>
  <para>When establishing the encryption key settings for your credit card and
  EFT configuration, you are presented with the following options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Key File Name</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the name of your key file. The key file is an encryption
        seed file, which enables you to read encrypted credit card and EFT
        information. The key file is required regardless of the verification
        service used at your site. The contents of the key file should be at
        least 16 characters long and use a combination of upper and lower case
        letters and numbers. Special characters should not be used.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <note>
    <para>If you change the contents of your key file after it has already
    been in production, steps must be taken to convert any data encrypted up
    to that point. The function <literal>alterencrypt</literal> must be used
    to handle the conversion. Please contact your systems administrator for
    more information.</para>

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Windows Location</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the directory path any Windows machine on your system
        would use to access the key file. All users and machines on the system
        must use the same key file. To ensure consistency and security, the
        file should be stored in a central location.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <tip>
    <para>If you name the key file "OpenMFG.key" and place it in the
    installation directory, then you do not need to enter the path.</para>

      <term>Linux Location</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the directory path any Linux machine on your system
        would use to access the key file. All users and machines on the system
        must use the same key file. To ensure consistency and security, the
        file should be stored in a central location.</para>
