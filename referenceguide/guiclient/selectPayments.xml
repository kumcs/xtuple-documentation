            <term>Older than</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>Select to show open Payables whose due date is older than
              the date entered.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>Select to show open Payables whose due date falls within

  <note>
    <para>When a Check is created to satisfy an open Payable, the value
    displayed in the amount due column will be adjusted automatically to
    reflect the Check amount. For example, if a Check is issued for the full
    amount due, the value in the amount due column will adjust to "0". Once a
    Check for the full amount is posted, the open Payable will be removed
    from the Select Payments list altogether.</para>

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Open Items</term>
      <listitem>

  <note>
    <para>Open items may be placed on hold&mdash;or reopened&mdash; using the
    right-click menu on this screen. When on hold, open items may not be
    selected for payment.</para>
  </note>
  <tip>
    <para>Be alert to negative balances in the amount due column. A negative
    balance indicates that Checks have been issued for more than the amount
    due. To correct this situation, view your Check Run and void any
    superfluous Checks.</para>

        default option, you must specify a Bank Account each time you select

        fully applied&mdash;or until there are no more open items for the credit to
        be applied against. This process continues applying all available
        Credit Memos based on their due date. </para>
