    <para>If Payments being printed contain reference lines which spill over

      <term>Bank Account</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the Bank Account associated with the Payment Run you
        want to print. Only Bank Accounts which require printing will have
        Payments to print. If the specified Bank Account is configured to use
        Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), the CREATE EFT FILE button will be
        enabled on this screen.</para>
      </listitem>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Next Payment #</term>

        first Payment Number displayed above. The maximum possible selection
        indicates the maximum number of Payments in the Payment Run. Selecting
        a number less than the maximum will cause that number of Payments to
        be printed, leaving the remaining number still to be printed.</para>
        <note>
