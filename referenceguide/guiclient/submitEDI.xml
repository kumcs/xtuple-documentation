  <para id="submitEDI"><informalexample>
      <para>You may be presented with one of two screens, depending on whether
      the document will be sent by email or by FTP. If you do not see either
      screen, the EDI Profile has been set to disable review before sending
      and will automatically be sent to the xTuple Connect Batch
      Manager.</para>
      <para>If the document will be sent by email, you will see the following
      screen:</para>

        <caption><para>Review EDI Before Sending a document by
        email</para></caption>
      </mediaobject>
      <para>The fields at the top of the window show basic information about
      the EDI that will be sent:</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>This shows the document number of the document you want to
            schedule for delivery. Which label appears depends on the document
            being sent. The "Customer #" is shown when sending A/R
            Statements.</para>

      <para>The information in the following fields will be populated from the
      EDI Profile. If you have the "EditEDIBeforeSending" privilege, you will
      be allowed to edit the contents of these fields. You are presented with
      the following email-specific options:</para>
      <variablelist>

          <term>From</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>This is the email address of the person sending the email.
            It can be set to the address of the user running the application
            or a generic address (e.g. "sales@xtuple.com"). If it is left
            blank on this screen, the xTuple Connect Batch Manager will fill
            in the email address of the user running the application at the
            time the EDI was prepared.</para>

                  <para>The Query Set defined in the EDI Forms for the EDI
                  Profile will be run. The results will be used to build a

                  the drop-down list that appears when "Delimited Text" is
                  selected. </para>
                  <para>Pre-defined characters include the comma (",") and
                  tab. If you need to change the delimiter, select "[ not
                  delimited ]" from the drop-down menu, then replace that text
                  with your own single character. Normally, however, this
                  should be left to the value specified in the EDI
                  Profile.</para>

                  <para>The Query Set defined in the EDI Forms for the EDI
                  Profile will be run. The results will be used to build an

                  <para>The Query Set defined in the EDI Forms for the EDI
                  Profile will be run. The results will be used to build an
                  XML file. Each row of output will be represented by an XML
                  element named for the query that generated it and will
                  contain child elements for the individual fields. Each field
                  of output will be represented by an element with the name of
                  the query result column and will contain the value of that
                  field as the text of the element.</para>
                  <para>The resulting XML can be transformed to another format
                  by selecting from the list of XSLT mappings that appears
                  when "XML" is selected.</para>

                <listitem>
                  <para>For Delimited Text, this will insert a line before
                  each query showing the query result column names separated
                  by the delimiting character. For HTML, this will insert a
                  row at the beginning of each query's results showing the
                  query results column names. This is ignored for PDF and XML
                  output.</para>

                  attachment. For Forms and Reports it should end with a
                  ".pdf" suffix. For comma-delimited files the output file
                  should end with ".csv". Tab-delimited files should have a
