  <para>To create a new custom screen, select the NEW button. The following
  window will appear:</para>
  <para><screenshot>
      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/uiform.png" />
        </imageobject>
        <caption>Create New Screen</caption>
      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot></para>
  <para>When creating a new custom screen, you are presented with the
  following options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Name</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter a name to describe the screen.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Notes</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter some brief notes to describe the screen.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Order</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the ranking of the screen. Having an order is useful
        when you have more than one screen with the same name--as when testing
        different versions of the same screen, for example. The version of the
        screen having the lowest number will be used (e.g., 0 will be executed
        before 1). To switch between screen versions, simply give the screen
        you want to run the lowest number.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Enabled</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to enable the screen. If not selected, the screen will be
        disabled.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Scripts</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Display lists any scripts associated with the screen. Scripts
        may be added/removed, enabled/disabled, and ordered according to
        need.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <para>To the far right of the screen, the following buttons are
  available:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>CANCEL</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Closes the screen without saving any changes.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>SAVE</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Saves the screen definition, including any UI file which you may
        have imported. The screen definition and the UI file are both saved to
        the database.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>IMPORT</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to import the UI file you want to use as the basis for
        your custom screen. UI files should be created using Qt Designer. When
        they are imported using this option, they are stored in the database
        and associated with the specified screen definition. If you ever want
        or need to edit the UI file and do not have a copy stored locally, you
        can simply export the UI file to your file system--and then re-import
        it when you are done editing. Whenever you import a UI file, it
        automatically replaces whatever UI file was in place before it.</para>
        <warning>
          <para>Every time you import a UI file, the new UI file replaces
          whatever UI file was imported previously--regardless of the name of
          the file(s).</para>
        </warning>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>EXPORT</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to export the UI file associated with the screen. You
        would use this option if you need or want to edit the UI file and do
        not have a copy stored locally on your system. Once exported, the UI
        can be edited using Qt Designer--and then re-imported into the
        database using the import option. Whenever you import a UI file, it
        automatically replaces whatever UI file was in place before it.</para>
