        Customer. The list of available Items may vary from Customer to

        will be selectable from this Site list. By default, the Item Site
        having the highest Ranking will be selected as the first available
        Site. If more than one Item Site share a Ranking of "1," the Sites
        will be sorted in alphabetical order. Item Site Rankings are set on

      <listitem>
        <para>Displays the Unit Price for the Quote Item. By default, the
        system will choose the lower of the following two Prices: A) The
        most-specific Pricing Schedule Assignment or B) any Sale in effect at
        the time of Order entry. The specificity of Pricing Schedule
        Assignments is determined in the following descending order: By
        Customer Ship-To Address (most specific), by Customer, by Customer
        Type, by Customer Type pattern, by all Customers. The lookup feature
        located to the right of the field leads to a Price List screen.</para>
        <para>If your Pricing Schedule has multiple Units of Measure (UOM) on
        it (or if several Pricing Schedules share the same level of Price
        specificity, but they have different UOMs) then the UOM which matches
        the selected UOM will be chosen&mdash;that is, as long as the quantity
        break does not exceed the quantity being priced. If no entry matches
        the UOM with a quantity break less than the quantity being priced,
        then the lowest value Price for any UOM will be chosen. To make sure a
        specific UOM is always chosen at the desired level of Price
        specificity, then your Pricing Schedules should include at least one
        UOM with a quantity break of 0.</para>
