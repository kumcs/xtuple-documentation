  <note>
    <para>Sales Credits are posted effective on the date they are distributed,
    not on the date they are posted—as might be assumed.</para>
  </note>
  <para>When posting Sales Credits, you are presented with the following
  options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Post Unprinted Sales Credits</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to include unprinted Sales Credits in the list of Sales
        Credits to be posted. If not selected—and if there are unprinted Sales
        Credits waiting to be posted—you will be prompted to print the
        unprinted Sales Credits before posting may occur.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Print Sales Credit Journal</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to print the Sales Credit Journal in addition to posting
        the Sales Credits. Sales Credit Journals are assigned a unique
        identification number, which corresponds to the Sales Credit batch and
        the date the batch was posted.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <note>
    <para>A Sales Credit Journal will also be created for Sales Credits that
    are posted individually—that is, not in batch mode, but one at a time. As
    with batch postings, the Sales Credit Journals for individually-posted
    Sales Credits are assigned a unique identification number.</para>
