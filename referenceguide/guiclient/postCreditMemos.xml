  <note>
    <para>Returns are posted effective on the date they are distributed, not
    on the date they are posted—as might be assumed.</para>
  </note>
  <para>When posting Returns, you are presented with the following
  options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Post Unprinted Returns</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to include unprinted Returns in the list of Returns to be
        posted. If not selected—and if there are unprinted Returns waiting to
        be posted—you will be prompted to print the unprinted Returns before
        posting may occur.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Print Return Journal</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to print the Return Journal in addition to posting the
        Returns. Return Journals are assigned a unique identification number,
        which corresponds to the Return batch and the date the batch was
        posted.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <note>
    <para>A Return Journal will also be created for Returns that are posted
    individually—that is, not in batch mode, but one at a time. As with batch
    postings, the Return Journals for individually-posted Returns are assigned
    a unique identification number.</para>
