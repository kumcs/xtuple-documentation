  <note>
    <para>Credit Memos are posted effective on the date they are distributed,
    not on the date they are posted&mdash;as might be assumed.</para>
  </note>
  <para>When posting Credit Memos, you are presented with the following
  options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Post Unprinted Credit Memos</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to include unprinted Credit Memos in the list of Credit
        Memos to be posted. If not selected&mdash;and if there are unprinted Credit
        Memos waiting to be posted&mdash;you will be prompted to print the
        unprinted Credit Memos before posting may occur.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Print Credit Memo Journal</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to print the Credit Memo Journal in addition to posting
        the Credit Memos. Credit Memo Journals are assigned a unique
        identification number, which corresponds to the Credit Memo batch and
        the date the batch was posted.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <note>
    <para>A Credit Memo Journal will also be created for Credit Memos that are
    posted individually&mdash;that is, not in batch mode, but one at a time. As
    with batch postings, the Credit Memo Journals for individually-posted
    Credit Memos are assigned a unique identification number.</para>
