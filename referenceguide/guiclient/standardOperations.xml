  <title>Standard Operations</title>

  <para>Standard operations are routine operations which may occur throughout
  the manufacturing process at multiple work centers. Storing these operations
  in the master information section streamlines the process of assigning
  operations to routings. The operations defined here may be accessed from the
  Routing Item screen. To access the master list of standard operations, go to
  <guimenuitem>Products &gt; Setup &gt; Master Information &gt; Standard
  Operations</guimenuitem>. The following screen will appear.</para>
