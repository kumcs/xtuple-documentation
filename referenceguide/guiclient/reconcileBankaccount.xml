  <para>When reconciling a Bank Account, you are presented with the following
  options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Bank Account</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the Bank Account you want to reconcile.</para>

    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Currency</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Displays the Currency of the selected Bank Account. To help with
        the reconciliation of foreign Currency transactions, the screen allows
        you to edit the Exchange Rate for specific transactions. Simply click
        on the "Exchange Rate" field for a given record to edit the Exchange
        Rate for that record. Once the rate has been edited, double-click on
        the row to save the changes. This feature is designed to help you
        reconcile your Bank Accounts only and does <emphasis>not</emphasis>
        have any impact on the General Ledger or your global Exchange
        Rates.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Exchange Rate Edit</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select if you want the ability to edit the Exchange Rate for any
        posted deposits or payments. Editing Exchange Rates for Bank
        Reconciliation purposes does not impact the General Ledger. When this
        option is selected, simply double-click on a record to edit its
        Exchange Rate―then select the UPDATE button to finalize the edit. You
        must select the UPDATE button for the new Exchange Rate to be
        recognized. If this option is not selected, you may not edit Exchange
        Rates. </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Start Date</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>By default the start date field will be pre-populated based on
        the end date of your most recent Bank Reconciliation—if it exists. The
        date used will be one day after the previous Bank Reconciliation end
        date. If you want to use a different start date, simply edit the date
        to your preferred date. Keep in mind that once a date range has been
        reconciled, it's not possible to re-reconcile the same range twice.
        You must select new date range.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>End Date</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the ending date of the current Bank Reconciliation
        period. Bank Reconciliations are identified by their date ranges, for
        reporting purposes. Keep in mind that once a date range has been
        reconciled, it's not possible to re-reconcile the same range twice.
        You must select new date range.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>By default the opening balance field will be pre-populated with
        the ending balance of your most recent Bank Reconciliation—if it
        exists. If you want to use a different opening balance, simply edit
        the amount to your preferred amount.</para>
