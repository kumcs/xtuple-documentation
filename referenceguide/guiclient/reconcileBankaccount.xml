    <para>To reopen a posted bank reconciliation, go to the Summarized Bank

  <para>When reconciling a bank account, you are presented with the following
  options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Bank Account</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the bank account you want to reconcile.</para>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Currency</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Displays the currency of the selected bank account. To help with
        the reconciliation of foreign currency transactions, the screen allows
        you to edit the exchange rate for specific transactions. Simply click
        on the <guilabel>Exchange Rate</guilabel> field for a given record to
        edit the exchange rate for that record. Once the rate has been edited,
        double-click on the row to save the changes. This feature is designed
        to help you reconcile your bank accounts only and does
        <emphasis>not</emphasis> have any impact on the general ledger or your
        global exchange rates.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Exchange Rate Edit</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select if you want the ability to edit the exchange rate for any
        posted deposits or payments. Editing exchange rates for bank
        reconciliation purposes does not impact the general ledger. When this
        option is selected, simply double-click on a record to edit its
        exchange rate—then select the <guibutton>UPDATE</guibutton> button to
        finalize the edit. You must select the <guibutton>UPDATE</guibutton>
        button for the new exchange rate to be recognized. If this option is
        not selected, you may not edit exchange rates. When cash-based tax
        distribution is used, this field is called <guilabel>Exchange
        Rate/Effective Date Edit</guilabel> and double-clicking a record will
        enable you to change the effective date as well as the exchange
        rate.</para>
        <tip>
          <para>To work on a bank reconciliation over several sessions, simply
          select the <guibutton>SAVE</guibutton> button. Your work will be
          saved and ready when you return.</para>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Start Date</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>By default the start date field will be pre-populated based on
        the end date of your most recent bank reconciliation—if it exists. The
        date used will be one day after the previous bank reconciliation end
        date. If you want to use a different start date, simply edit the date
        to your preferred date. Keep in mind that once a date range has been
        reconciled, it's not possible to re-reconcile the same range twice.
        You must select new date range.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>End Date</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the ending date of the current bank reconciliation
        period. Bank reconciliations are identified by their date ranges, for
        reporting purposes. Keep in mind that once a date range has been
        reconciled, it's not possible to re-reconcile the same range twice.
        You must select new date range.</para>

        be pre-populated with the ending balance of your most recent bank
        reconciliation—if it exists. If you want to use a different opening
        balance, simply edit the amount to your preferred amount.</para>

        <para>Select to import a bank statement file in .CSV format. This
        button will be hidden if you have not configured the system to allow
        the importing of bank records. When you select this button, the Import
        Data screen will be launched using the specified bank account and
        period being reconciled. You will then follow the instructions in the
        Import Data screen to complete the import. The data import program
        will attempt to match bank entries with existing records based on
        check numbers, dates, and amounts. During this process, you will be
        able to manually associate any bank records that did not find a match.
        You will also be able to manually disassociate mis-matched entries. In
        addition, you may convert any unmatched entry into a manual bank
        adjustment, miscellaneous check, or journal entry. Color coding is
        used to indicate cleared records associated with matched bank account
        imports (i.e., the color green = matched).</para>
