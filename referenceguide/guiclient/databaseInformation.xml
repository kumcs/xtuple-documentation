        <para>The description entered here will be displayed in the Title Bar
        of the main window. This field is typically used to store company
        names and/or the particular name of the server where the server
        software is running (e.g., "ABC Manufacturing - Production

          <para>The network address for the server is set using the OPTIONS

          application. The server address initially assigned to a user will
          display in the "Server Address" field. If the server address is ever
          changed, you will need to notify all users to update their login
          options.</para>

        <para>Select if you want to disable the auto-complete functionality
        for anyone using the "Menu" search navigation option. Not selecting

    <varlistentry role="standard">
      <term>Do not allow user logins that exceed licensed user count</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select if you want to prevent users from logging in once you've
        hit your limit for maximum concurrent licensed users. Turning this
        flag on puts a hard limit on concurrent logins, thereby shielding
        users from messages warning them that the user count has been
        exceeded. If not selected, users logging in after the license limit
        has been met will be presented with a warning message. This setting
        only affects commercial editions of xTuple ERP. To learn more about
        xTuple license limits, please see <xref

      <term>Access Mode</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify one of the following options to determine which users
        should be able to access the database:</para>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>Active Users Only</term>

          </varlistentry>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>Admin Users Only (Maintenance Mode)</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>Select to allow only system admin users to access the
              database. This is a useful mode during periods when you are
              performing database maintenance and don't want end users
              accessing the system.</para>
            </listitem>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>Any Users not Inactive</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>Select to allow any users who are either active or
              undefined to access the database. This option differs from the
              "Active Users Only" option because it also allows PostgreSQL
              server users to access the database, even though they may not
              have a user account on the database. In other words, the user is
              defined on the server but not on the database. This option could
              be useful when loading new databases which haven't had all their
              users defined yet. Undefined users will be allowed to access the
              database. However, they will need a system admin to grant them
              privileges to fully use the system.</para>

      <term>Number of Database Users</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Displays the total number of concurrent xTuple ERP client user
        connections combined with any non-xTuple ERP connections (e.g.,
        pgAdmin, third-party software tools, etc.) for the xTuple ERP Database
        whose "Database Information" screen you are looking at. Keep in mind
        that concurrent connections made by xTuple tools such as xTuple
        Connect, the Updater, CSVimp, and others count toward your maximum
        concurrent xTuple client users total. To get an accurate view of all
        your current connections, use the following menu path from the xTuple
        Desktop: <guimenu>Window &gt; Desktop &gt; Users
        Online</guimenu>.</para>

    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Number of Server Users</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Displays the total number of concurrent users connected to the
        PostgreSQL server where the xTuple ERP Database is running. Because
        it's possible to have more than one database running on a PostgreSQL
        server instance, the total number of concurrent users accessing the
        databases on that server may exceed the total number of concurrent
        users connected to a single xTuple ERP Database.</para>
