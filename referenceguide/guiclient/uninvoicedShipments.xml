  <para>An uninvoiced shipment is a shipment having one or more uninvoiced
  sales order line items. To invoice a sales order line item, you need to

  quantity. Once the invoice is created, the selected line item will be
  considered invoiced. To view a list of Uninvoiced Shipments, select the
  "Uninvoiced Shipments" option. The following screen will appear:</para>
