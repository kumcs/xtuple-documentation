  <para>An uninvoiced shipment is a shipment having one or more uninvoiced
  sales order line items. To invoice a sales order line item, you need to
  approve the order for billing and then specifically approve the line item
  quantity. Once the invoice is created, the selected line item will be
  considered invoiced. To view a list of uninvoiced shipments, select the
  <guimenuitem>Uninvoiced Shipments</guimenuitem> option. The following screen
  will appear:</para>
