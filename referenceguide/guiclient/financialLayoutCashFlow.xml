  <para>Because Cash Flow statements can vary so widely, there is no
  system-defined Cash Flow template. To create your own Cash Flow statement,
  select the "Cash Flow" report type. The following screen will appear:</para>
  <para role="xtprjaccnt"><note>
      <para>If the xTuple Project Accounting package is installed, you will
      have the option to make the Cash Flow report available to
      Projects.</para>

  <para>To create the row layouts for a Cash Flow report, you would follow the
  same basic steps as described in <xref linkend="Section590389" />. The only
  difference is you won"t need to specify which balances to calculate (e.g.,
  beginning, ending, etc.). Because the Cash Flow report is one of three
  standard statement formats, the system determines which calculations will be
  done.</para>
  <tip>
    <para>To build row layouts for the three standard report
    types&mdash;Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow&mdash;use the
    same techniques as when building Ad Hoc report row layouts. The only
    difference is you won"t need to specify which balances to calculate (e.g.,
    beginning, ending, etc.). The system determines which calculations will be
    done for the standard statement formats.</para>
  </tip>
  <para>In addition to row layouts, you may also define column layouts for
  your Cash Flow report. Column layouts are used to specify the time buckets
  financial information will be sorted into. You specify a column layout to
  use when viewing or printing Financial Reports. You may define any number of
  column layouts. Each layout will be linked to either a pre-defined report
  definition or a custom report definition you create yourself.</para>
  <para>To create column layouts for a Cash Flow report, select the "Column
  Layouts" tab. The following screen will appear:</para>
