  <para>The Allocate Reservations utility enables you to allocate inventory to
  batches of open sales orders. This can be a more efficient method for
  quickly making hard inventory allocations, as compared to allocating
  inventory one-at-a-time at the individual sales order line item level. You
  can allocate inventory to batches of sales orders using the following
  screen:</para>

  <note>
    <para>Only sales order line items that can be completely reserved using
    actual quantity on hand (QOH) will be affected when this utility is run.
    If a line item cannot be completely reserved, it will be skipped.</para>
  </note>
  <para>When allocating inventory to batches of open sales orders, you are
  presented with the following options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Selected Customer</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to allocate inventory to an individual customer's open
        sales orders.</para>
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>Customer #</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>Specify the customer number of the customer whose open
              sales orders you want to allocate inventory to. The browse
              button located to the right of the field leads to a searchable
              customers list. You may also access this list using the keyboard
              shortcut <guibutton>CTRL + L</guibutton>. Once a customer number
              is entered, the customer name and billing address will display.
              Select the <guibutton>?</guibutton> or <guibutton>$</guibutton>
              symbol to view customer information for the specified customer.
              If a customer's credit is good, the button will feature a black
              question mark (<guibutton>?</guibutton>) icon. If the customer
              is on credit warning, the icon will turn into an orange dollar
              sign (<guibutton>$</guibutton>). A red dollar sign
              (<guibutton>$</guibutton>) indicates the customer is on credit
              hold.</para>

      <listitem>

        want to allocate inventory to. This is an optional setting which may
        be used in conjunction with the "Selected Customer" setting. The
        ship-to option gives you the added flexibility of being able to assign
        multiple Pricing schedules to a single customer based on separate
        ship-to addresses.</para>
