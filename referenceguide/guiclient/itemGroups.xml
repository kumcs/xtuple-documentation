  <para>Item groups provide an alternate means for sorting items into
  categories. The advantage to item groups is that a single item may belong to
  multiple item groups. This is in contrast to class codes and product
  Categories, in that single items may belong to only one of each of these
  categories. Item groups can include other item groups and Member items. To
  access the master list of item groups, select the <guimenuitem>Items Groups</guimenuitem> option. The
  following screen will appear:</para>

  <para>The Item Groups screen displays an alphabetical list of all existing
  item groups and their description. To see a list of item groups and Member
  items that belong to a Group, expand the Group by clicking on the arrow to
  the left of the Group.</para>
