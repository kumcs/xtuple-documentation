  <para>Packages are compressed files which may contain either a) custom
  software designed to extend the functionality of xTuple ERP without touching
  the core xTuple ERP source code or b) upgrade bundles designed to migrate
  xTuple ERP databases from one version to the next. Using packages,
  third-party software developers can add features without needing C++
  programming skills. And these features can be integrated seamlessly into
  xTuple ERP independent of the release cycles and source code requirements
  defined by xTuple. In short, packages are flexible. And they make it easy
  for software developers to add new features—or even just simple tweaks—to
  customize and enhance the xTuple ERP experience. For additional information,
  please see the <ulink

  wiki page.</para>
