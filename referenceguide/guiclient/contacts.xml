  <para>Contacts are the people you do business with. They are linked to CRM
  Accounts, Incidents, Customer records, Vendor records, and more. You can
  create Contact records from this screen using the NEW button. Or you can
  create Contacts right on the screens where they are used. For example, if
  you are entering an Incident for a new Contact at an Account, you can create
  the Contact record on the Incident screen. That Contact will be added to the
  master list of Contacts.</para>
