  <para>When creating a new sales assignment, you are presented with the
  following options:</para>
  <tip>
    <para>The account numbers assigned to cost categories should not all be
    the inventory account. Instead, they should be individual accounts
    selected specifically for each cost-tracking purpose. This will increase
    your visibility into your inventory costs and valuation.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Specify site to be associated with the account
        assignment.</para>
        <note>
          <para>In the case of conflicts between sales assignments, the system
          by default selects specific assignments before all-inclusive ones.
          For example, if there were a choice between an assignment featuring
          <guilabel>WHSE-1</guilabel> as the supplying site and another
          featuring <guilabel>ANY</guilabel> site, the more-specific
          <guilabel>WHSE-1</guilabel> would be selected.</para>
