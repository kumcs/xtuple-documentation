  <para>When you post a Sales Order that has been selected for billing, an
  Invoice is created for that Order. This is the standard flow for creating
  Invoices tied to Sales Orders. However, you also have the option of creating
  miscellaneous Invoices—that is, Invoices which are not tied to Sales Orders.
  For example, you might use a miscellaneous Invoice to bill for non-Inventory
  Items you have sold. To create a miscellaneous Invoice, select the "Create
  Invoice" option. The following screen will appear:</para>

        <para>Next available Invoice Number will automatically display, unless

        generated from the Select for Billing process flow. If the Invoice is
        miscellaneous and was not generated by the Select for Billing process,
        then use this field for informational or reference purposes. Possible
        references might include Sales Order Number or Customer Purchase Order
        Number.</para>

        shortcut "CTRL + L". Once a Customer Number is entered, the Customer
        name and billing address will display. Select the "?" or "$" symbol to
        view Customer information for the specified Customer. If a Customer's
        credit is "In Good Standing," the button will feature a black question
        mark ("?") icon. If the icon turns to an orange dollar sign ("$"), the
        Customer's credit Status is "On Credit Warning." A red dollar sign
        ("$") indicates the Customer's credit Status is "On Credit
        Hold."</para>
