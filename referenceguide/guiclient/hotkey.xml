  <para>Hot keys are designed to create user-defined shortcuts, by linking
  particular screens with keyboard keystrokes. For example, you might link the
  <guibutton>F1</guibutton> key to the Customer list. Using this hot key, you
  could open the Customer list by simply selecting <guibutton>F1</guibutton>.
  You may create up to 42 hot keys using the available keystroke options. The
  hot keys you create will also be displayed as shortcuts on the xTuple
  desktop.</para>

  <para>To create a new hot key, select the <guibutton>NEW</guibutton> button.
