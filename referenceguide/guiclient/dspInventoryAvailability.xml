  <para>The "Inventory Availability" screen is a valuable tool for Inventory
  managers and production planners&mdash;particularly when used in conjunction with
  the planning and scheduling features found in the commercial editions of
  xTuple ERP. From this screen you can get a quick overview of the current
  availability for all of your Inventory Items. And with the right-click menu
  you can easily drill down to research the specific details underlying the
  summary information shown here.</para>
  <para>Here are some tips for using this screen:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>If you don't see the orders or other information you are looking
      for, make sure to check your "As of" date setting. If orders or activity
      don't fall within the specified "As of" time frame, then you won't see
      this information displayed on the screen.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>When Planned Availability displays in the color orange, this means
      the actual or projected Quantity on Hand is at or below the Reorder
      Level. When the color is red, the current or projected Quantity on Hand
      is below 0.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>When quantity appears in the "On Order" column, this refers to
      quantity that is on order through either a Work Order or Purchase Order.
      In the case of Purchase Orders, the quantity will always be represented
      in the Inventory Unit of Measure (UOM)&mdash;regardless of the Vendor
      UOM used on the Purchase Order.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>The right-click menu is context-sensitive within each row of
      information. If a right-click option is unavailable, that means there is
      no detailed information to view for that column during the specified
      time frame.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

              a value up to a maximum of 1000. Future Availability for the

              Hand (QOH) values will be grayed out, indicating that all past
              and future supplies and demands have not been included in the
              calculation.</para>
