  <para>Customer Form assignments are used to specify which printed reports
  you want your customers to receive. You can make the assignments
  individually by customer&mdash;or by customer type. In the case where more
  than one Form assignment applies to a customer, the system will always use
  the most specific reference first. For example, a Form assignment for an
  individual customer is more specific than a Form assignment for an entire
  customer type, etc. To access the Customer Form assignments master list,
  select the "Customer Form Assignments" option. The following screen will
  appear:</para>
