  <para>Customer form assignments are used to specify which printed reports
  you want your customers to receive. You can make the assignments
  individually by customerâ€”or by customer type. In the case where more than
  one form assignment applies to a customer, the system will always use the
  most specific reference first. For example, a form assignment for an
  individual customer is more specific than a form assignment for an entire
  customer type, etc. To access the Customer Form Assignments master list, go
  to <guimenuitem>Sales &gt; Setup</guimenuitem><guimenuitem> &gt; Master
  Information &gt; Customer Form Assignments</guimenuitem>. The following
  screen will appear:</para>
