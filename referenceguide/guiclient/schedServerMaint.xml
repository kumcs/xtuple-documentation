  <title>Schedule Server Maintenance</title>
  <para>The server maintenance utility is designed to perform automated
  maintenance on xTuple databases. The default task is to REINDEX the
  database. This can be changed and additional tasks added if desired. For
  more information see the xTuple Connect Product Guide.<note>
      <para>The user who schedules server maintenance must be a superuser
      (i.e., have the ability to create system users).</para>
    </note></para>
  <note>
    <para>Server maintenance with xTuple Connect 3.5.0 and earlier runs VACUUM
    FULL ANALYZE, followed by a REINDEX. For more information on these
    operations and also to learn more about the native auto vacuum feature
    found in newer versions of PostgreSQL, visit the PostgreSQL website at

      <listitem>
        <para>Displays the name of the action to be performed by the xTuple

              <para>Schedule a date and time to run the job. Specify a date in
              the first field using a standard date format. Use the arrow
              buttons in the second field to specify a time of day.</para>

  </variablelist>
  <note>
    <para>When a job is submitted to the xTuple Connect Batch Manager with a
    scheduled time of ASAP, the Batch Manager sets the scheduled time to the
    current time. However, a job will not necessarily be run immediately if it
    is scheduled for the current time. Any pre-existing jobs with scheduled
    times prior to the current time must be completed first. In other words,
    ASAP jobs will not necessarily be run immediately. Previously scheduled
    jobs will be run first.</para>
