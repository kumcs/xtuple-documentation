  <title>Schedule Server Maintenance</title>
  <para>The server maintenance utility is designed to perform automated
  maintenance on xTuple databases running on older versions of PostgreSQL. If
  you are running a newer version of PostgreSQL (i.e., version 8.2 and newer),
  you should use PostgreSQL's native auto vacuum functionality instead of the
  xTuple server maintenance utility.</para>
  <note>
    <para>When the server maintenance utility is run, a VACUUM FULL ANALYZE
    operation is run on your database, followed by a REINDEX. The user who
    schedules server maintenance must be a superuser (i.e., have the ability
    to create system users). For more information on these operations and also
    to learn more about the native auto vacuum feature found in newer versions
    of PostgreSQL, visit the PostgreSQL website at <ulink id="Hypertext956137"
    url="http://www.postgresql.com">http://www.postgresql.com</ulink>.</para>
  </note>
  <para>To run the server maintenance utility, select the "Schedule Server
  Maintenance" option. The following screen will appear:</para>

    </screenshot></para>
  <para>When scheduling server maintenance, you are presented with the
  following options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Action</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Displays the name of the action to be performed by the Batch
        Manager. In this case, the name of the action is
        serverMaintenance.</para>

    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Response Email</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>By default, the email address of the logged-in user will be
        entered here. This address may be edited or changed.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Scheduled</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select one of the following Schedule options:</para>
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>ASAP</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>Select to have the job run as soon as possible.</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>Scheduled</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>Schedule a date and time to run the job. Specify a date in
              the first field using a standard date format. Use the arrow
              buttons in the second field to specify a time of day.</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <note>
    <para>When a job is submitted to the Batch Manager with a scheduled time
    of ASAP, the Batch Manager sets the scheduled time to the current time.
    However, a job will not necessarily be run immediately if it is scheduled
    for the current time. Any pre-existing jobs with scheduled times prior to
    the current time must be completed first. In other words, ASAP jobs will
    not necessarily be run immediately. Previously scheduled jobs will be run
    first.</para>
  </note>
  <para>To the far right of the screen, the following buttons are
  available:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>CANCEL</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Closes the screen without performing server maintenance,
        returning you to the application desktop.</para>
      </listitem>
