  <para>If a sales order or Transfer Order has been shipped in error—or if
  changes need to be made to an Order prior to final billing—you may recall
  the Order to Shipping. However, once an Invoice has been posted (or a
  Transfer Order has been closed), it may no longer be recalled to shipping.
  To recall Orders to Shipping, select the "Recall Orders to Shipping" option.
  The following screen will appear:</para>

  <para>When recalling an Order to Shipping, you are presented with the
  following options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Show Invoiced</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to include Invoiced Orders in the display. By default,
        only unposted Invoices will be shown. However, you can see all
        Invoices?unposted <emphasis>and</emphasis> posted?if you have the
        "RecallInvoicedShipment" privilege. An Order is considered "invoiced"
        after an Invoice has been created from a billing selection. In some
        cases, it may be desirable to completely back out an Invoice using the
        following steps:</para>
