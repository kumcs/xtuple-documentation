  using the right-click menu on the Vendor history screen. To display unposted

  <note>
    <para>Actual Costs for purchased Items will be automatically updated when
    Vouchers are posted if there are differences between current Actual Costs
    and the vouchered Costs for the Items in question. Please keep in mind
    that Actual Costs only will be updated at posting. For new Costs to be
    recognized as Standard Costs, Actual Costs must be posted to
    Standard.</para>
  </note>
  <para>The "Vouchers" screen displays information on all unposted Vouchers,
  including Voucher Number, Purchase Order Number, Vendor Number/Vendor name,
  Vendor Invoice Number, and distribution date. Users with the appropriate
  privilege will also see the G/L distribution date column.</para>
  <tip>
    <para>You may select multiple Vouchers for posting by highlighting them
    using your mouse&mdash;or a combination of your mouse and either the SHIFT
    or CTRL keys.</para>

  <para>The following buttons are unique to this screen:</para>

    <para>If you have a Purchase Order Voucher that was corrupted by, for
    example, a sudden power outage, you can clear the record by running the
    Post Vouchers screen. In most cases, this action will remove the corrupted
    record and allow you to voucher the Purchase Order with a fresh
    Voucher.</para>

      <listitem id="openVouchersPOST">
        <para>Highlight one&mdash;or multiple&mdash;Vouchers, then select this
        button to post the selected Voucher(s). By default, Vouchers post to
        the General Ledger (G/L) on their distribution date. However, users
        with the appropriate privilege may change the G/L distribution date to
        an alternate date during the Voucher posting process. If used,
        Vouchers will post on the alternate date. The ability privileged users
        have to change the distribution date applies to the posting of both
        individual and also batches of Vouchers from this screen.</para>
