  <para>The difference between the indented view and the single level view is
  that the indented view displays Costs for all subcomponents if there is a
  manufactured component listed on the Bill of Materials list. To view
  associated Item Costs using an indented Bill of Materials, select the
  "Costed Indented BOM" option. The following screen will appear:</para>

  <para>When displaying Costs for an indented Bill of Materials, you are
  presented with the following options:</para>
  <variablelist>

      <term>Item Number</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the Item Number of the manufactured Item whose associated

      <listitem>
        <para>If Revision Control is enabled at your site, specify the Bill of
        Materials Revision Number you want to view. If none exists, simply
        enter a value to create one. The status of the Revision will also be
        displayed. The following statuses apply to Revisions:</para>

              <para>This is the current, default Revision used for costing and
              Material Requirements Planning (MRP). Only one Revision can be
              active at the same time. Active Revisions may be modified.
              However, once a Revision becomes inactive, it may no longer be
              changed.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Select to display Standard Costs for component Items in the
        specified Item's Bill of Materials. Both the Unit Cost and Extended
        Cost for each component Item, expressed in terms of Standard Cost,
        will display&mdash;assuming Standard Costs have been defined for each
        component Item.</para>

  <tip>
    <para>When Labor and Overhead are posted to the General Ledger, they are
    posted using their Actual Cost. This is a departure from the rule which
    governs materials&mdash;namely, that materials are always posted using
    their Standard Cost. Differences between Actual and Standard Labor and
    Overhead Costs will be reflected in Inventory Cost Variances when Work
    Order Production or Operations are posted. You can address these variances
    if and when they occur by posting your Actual Costs to Standard.</para>

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Use Actual Costs</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to display Actual Costs for component Items in the
        specified Item's Bill of Materials. Both the Unit Cost and Extended
        Cost for each component Item, expressed in terms of Actual Cost, will
        display&mdash;assuming Actual Costs have been defined for each

    <para>The totals displayed on the screen are derived as follows:</para>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Total Cost</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>This total is pulled from the Extended Cost column. The total
          may vary, depending on whether "Use Standard Costs" or "Use Actual
          Costs" is selected.</para>

      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Actual Cost</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>This value represents the Actual Cost for the parent Item
          whose Costed Indented BOM is being displayed.</para>

      <varlistentry>

      <term>Costed Bill of Materials</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Display lists Costed Indented Bill of Materials components,
        using the specified parameters. The difference between the indented
        view and the single level view is that the indented view displays all
        subcomponents if there is a manufactured component listed on the Bill
        of Materials. The Total Cost, Actual Cost, and Standard Cost will be
        calculated automatically at the bottom of the display.</para>
