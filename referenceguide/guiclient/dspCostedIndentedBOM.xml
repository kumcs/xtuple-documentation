  <para>The difference between the indented view and the single level view is
  that the indented view displays costs for all subcomponents if there is a
  manufactured component listed on the bill of materials (BOMs) list. To view
  associated item costs using an indented BOMs, select the <guimenuitem>Costed
  Indented BOM</guimenuitem> option. The following screen will appear:</para>

  <para>When displaying costs for an indented BOMs, you are presented with the
  following options:</para>

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Item Number</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the item number of the manufactured item whose associated
        costs you would like to view using an indented BOMs.</para>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Revision</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>If revision control is enabled at your site, specify the BOMs
        revision number you want to view. If none exists, simply enter a value
        to create one. The status of the revision will also be displayed. The
        following statuses apply to revisions:</para>

        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>Active</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>This is the current, default revision used for costing and
              material requirements planning (MRP). Only one revision can be
              active at the same time. Active revisions may be modified.
              However, once a revision becomes inactive, it may no longer be
              changed.</para>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Use Standard Costs</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Select to display standard costs for component items in the
        specified item's BOMs. Both the unit cost and extended cost for each
        component item, expressed in terms of standard cost, will
        display—assuming standard costs have been defined for each component
        item.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>

  <tip>
    <para>When labor and overhead are posted to the general ledger, they are
    posted using their actual cost. This is a departure from the rule which
    governs materials—namely, that materials are always posted using their
    standard cost. Differences between actual and standard labor and overhead
    costs will be reflected in inventory cost variances when work order
    production or operations are posted. You can address these variances if
    and when they occur by posting your actual costs to standard.</para>
  </tip>

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Use Actual Costs</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Select to display actual costs for component items in the
        specified item's BOMs. Both the unit cost and extended cost for each
        component item, expressed in terms of actual cost, will
        display—assuming actual costs have been defined for each component
        item.</para>

  <note>
    <para>The totals displayed on the screen are derived as follows:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Total Cost</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>This total is pulled from the <guilabel>Extended
          Cost</guilabel> column—and reflects the real time total cost for the
          specified item. The total cost may differ from the actual or
          standard totals in cases where real time cost updates have not yet
          been rolled up into the specified parent item.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Actual Cost</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>This value represents the actual cost for the parent item
          whose costed indented BOM is being displayed.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Standard Cost</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>This value represents the standard cost for the parent item
          whose costed indented BOM is being displayed.</para>

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Costed Bill of Materials</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Display lists costed indented BOMs components, using the
        specified parameters. The difference between the indented view and the
        single level view is that the indented view displays all subcomponents
        if there is a manufactured component listed on the BOMs. The total
        cost, actual cost, and standard cost will be calculated automatically
        at the bottom of the display.</para>
