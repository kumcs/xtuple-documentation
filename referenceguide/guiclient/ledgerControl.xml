  <title>Ledger Control</title>
  <para>The Ledger Control report is designed to help you validate your
  accounting during the month-end closing process. The report provides a
  summarized overview of the key ledger control points, comparing the
  difference between Ledger and Sub Ledger amounts. This information can help
  you identify (at a high level) areas in the accounting system that require
  further investigation. To learn more about how to use the Ledger Control
  report as a starting point for further action, please see the <ulink

  your ledger control accounts</ulink> article.</para>
  <para>To access the Ledger Control report, select the "Ledger Control"
  option. The following screen will appear:</para>

  <para>As you can see in the screenshot, the report groups the Ledger control
  points into six core categories: Payables, Uninvoiced Receipts, Receivables,
  Inventory, WIP, and Shipping Assets. Within each category, the report shows
  the difference between summarized Ledger and Sub Ledger activity. The goal,
  of course, is to show a difference of $0 for each category. If the
  difference does not equal to $0, that means you have work to do analyzing
  the reason(s) for the difference and taking action to correct it. Keep in
  mind that these figures are summarized. In most, if not all, cases, the
  information shown is drawn from multiple accounts and document types.</para>
