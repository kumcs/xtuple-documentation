  <para>To the far right of the screen, the following buttons are
  available:</para>

        <para>Enables you to edit highlighted Invoices. The edit screen is the
        same as that for selecting a new Invoice&mdash;except that when

        <tip>
          <para>Deleting an Invoice effectively reverses the transaction which
          created it. In other words, when you delete an Invoice the source
          Sales Order will be returned to the Billing Selections list. From
          there, you have the ability to either A) cancel the Billing
          Selection or B) re-create the Invoice.</para>

        <para>Highlight one&mdash;or multiple&mdash;Invoices, then select this
        button to post the selected Invoice(s). By default, Invoices post to
        the General Ledger (G/L) on the Invoice date. However, users with the
        appropriate privilege may change the default G/L distribution date to
        an alternate date during the Invoice posting process. If used,
        Invoices will post on the alternate date. The ability privileged users
        have to change the distribution date applies to the posting of both
        individual and also batches of Invoices from this screen.</para>
