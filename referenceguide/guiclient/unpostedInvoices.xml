    <para>Deleting an invoice effectively reverses the transaction which
    created it. In other words, when you delete an invoice the source sales
    order will be returned to the <guilabel>Billing Selections</guilabel>
    list. From there, you have the ability to either A) cancel the billing
    selection or B) re-create the invoice.</para>
  </tip>
  <para>The Unposted Invoices list displays information on all invoices
  available for posting. Users with the appropriate privilege will also see
  the <guilabel>G/L Distribution Date</guilabel> column. To view the list of
  already-posted recurring invoices, see <xref
  linkend="dspRecurringInvoices"/>.</para>
