    <para>Deleting an Invoice effectively reverses the transaction which
    created it. In other words, when you delete an Invoice the source Sales
    Order will be returned to the Billing Selections list. From there, you
    have the ability to either A) cancel the Billing Selection or B) re-create
    the Invoice.</para>
  </tip>
  <para>The Unposted Invoices list displays information on all Invoices
  available for posting. Users with the appropriate privilege will also see
  the G/L distribution date column. To view the list of already-posted
  recurring Invoices, see <xref linkend="dspRecurringInvoices" />.</para>

      <para>If the Customer specified on the Invoice has an EDI Profile
      attached, you may encounter an EDI processing interface when printing
