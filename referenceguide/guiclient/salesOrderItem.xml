        calculated and the Net Unit Price for the Sales Order Item is
        determined.</para>
        <tip>
          <para>When Sales Orders are entered, the system will search for
          Quantity Break matches between the Sales Order Item and any relevant

        <para>Displays the Unit Price for the Sales Order Item. By default,
        the system will choose the lower of the following two Prices: A) The
        most-specific Pricing Schedule Assignment or B) any Sale in effect at
        the time of Order entry. The specificity of Pricing Schedule
        Assignments is determined in the following descending order: By
        Customer Ship-To Address (most specific), by Customer, by Customer
        Type, by Customer Type pattern, by all Customers. The lookup feature
        located to the right of the field leads to a Price List screen.</para>
        <para>If your Pricing Schedule has multiple Units of Measure (UOM) on
        it (or if several Pricing Schedules share the same level of Price
        specificity, but they have different UOMs) then the UOM which matches
        the selected UOM will be chosen&mdash;that is, as long as the quantity
        break does not exceed the quantity being priced. If no entry matches
        the UOM with a quantity break less than the quantity being priced,
        then the lowest value Price for any UOM will be chosen. To make sure a
        specific UOM is always chosen at the desired level of Price
        specificity, then your Pricing Schedules should include at least one
        UOM with a quantity break of 0.</para>

          site is configured to use drop shipping, an additional "Drop Ship"
          flag will also be shown for linked Purchase Orders. The drop ship
          function will search for an existing Purchase Order linked to the
          Sales Order with a matching Ship-To Address and add the Line Item to
          that Order&mdash;or create a new Order if none exists. Drop ship
          Purchase Orders inherit the Ship-To Address and Contact information

  <note>
    <para>Characteristics for configured Items (i.e., Job or Reference Items)
    also have List Prices associated with them. When configured Item
    Characteristics are added to a Sales Order Item, the overall Net Unit
    Price of the Item increases.</para>

  <para>When selecting or editing Characteristics for a Sales Order Line Item,
  you are presented with the following options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Name</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Displays the name of any Item Characteristics associated with
        the Item. Characteristics defined as Item Characteristics may be
        associated with Items on the Item master.</para>

      <term>Value</term>

        <para>Displays the default Value associated with an Item
        Characteristic, but permits you to specify an alternate Value. When
        associating Characteristic Values with a Sales Order Line Item, you
        have four options: 1) Select the default Value; 2) select an alternate
        pre-defined Value; 3) manually enter a new Value in place of the
        pre-defined Value; or 4) make no selection. Making no selection means
        the Characteristics will not be associated with the Sales Order Line
        Item.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>If the Sales Order Item is a configured Item (i.e., Job or
        Reference Item), the "Base Price" option will be shown.
        Characteristics associated with configured Items may have additional
        List Prices associated with them. As a result, when Characteristics
        are added to a Sales Order Item, the overall Price of the Item may
        increase. The Base Price shows the Price before any Characteristic
        List Prices have been added to the Net Unit Price. To learn more about
        adding price Characteristics to configured Items, see <xref
