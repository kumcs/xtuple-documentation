      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the customer number of the customer whose freight prices
        you want to view. The lookup feature located to the right of the field
        leads to a searchable customers list. You may also access this list
        using the keyboard shortcut "CTRL + L". Once a customer number is
        entered, the customer name and billing address will display. Select
        the "?" or "$" symbol to view customer information for the specified
        customer. If a customer's credit is "In Good Standing," the button
        will feature a black question mark ("?") icon. If the icon turns to an
        orange dollar sign ("$"), the customer's credit Status is "On Credit
        Warning." A red dollar sign ("$") indicates the customer's credit
        Status is "On Credit Hold."</para>
