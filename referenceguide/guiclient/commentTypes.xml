  <para>Comment types are required whenever you enter a new comment. They are
  used to distinguish between different categories of comments. There are two
  system-defined comment types (Changelog and General) and an unlimited number
  of possible user-defined comment types. User-defined comment types may be
  edited or deleted. System-defined comment types cannot be deleted, but the
  general comment type can be edited. You can also define the sort order for
  comment types to influence which comment types appear first at the top where
  there are used.</para>
  <para>Another "hidden" feature of comments is the ability to mark them as
  being either public or private. This feature can be useful if you are
  running xTuple Web Portal products where comments may be viewed in a public
  context. In the <literal>metric</literal> table of the xTuple database,
  there is a metric called <literal>CommentPublicPrivate</literal> which can
  be manually turned on to enable the public/private comment feature. If
  public/private comments are enabled, an additional metric called
  <literal>CommentPublicDefault</literal> defines whether new comments are
  public or private by default. For more information on how to set this up,
  please contact your xTuple system administrator.</para>
  <para>To access the master list of comment types, go to <guimenuitem>System
  &gt; Setup</guimenuitem>. In the Setup window, from the left side menu,
  select <guimenuitem>Master Information &gt; Comment Types</guimenuitem>. The
  following screen will appear:</para>
