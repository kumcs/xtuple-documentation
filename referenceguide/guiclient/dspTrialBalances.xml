  <para>The "Trial Balances" screen provides a mechanism for viewing the
  detailed financial information which underlies xTuple Financial Reports. The
  sequence of events is as follows: Transactions are posted to the General
  Ledger, these transactions update the Trial Balance, and Financial Reports
  use the Trial Balance when calculating their results.</para>
  <para>Here are some tips for using this screen:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Use the right-click menu to view the underlying G/L transactions
      which support the Trial Balance values.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>If G/L transactions are not posted, they will not appear in the
      Trial Balance. G/L transactions may be unposted if they were posted into
      a closed or non-existent Accounting Period.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Trial Balances will be automatically forward-updated unless your
      system is configured to manually forward-update Trial Balances. Ending
      balances cannot be forward-updated into future Periods. For more
      information see <xref linkend="Section942568" />.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Ending balances will display in orange type if either of the
      following conditions is true: 1) The ending balance has not been
      forward-updated, or 2) the ending balance has been forward-updated, but
      the account in question has no activity during the specified
      Period.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>For Fiscal Year closings, the system will automatically reset the
      beginning balances for Revenue and Expense Accounts to $0 at the start
      of a new Fiscal Year. However, for the Year-End Equity Account, the
      beginning balance for the first Period of the Fiscal Year will be equal
      to the ending balance for the previous year.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>A "CR" may display after the following columns: Beg. Bal.,
      Difference, and End. Bal. The "CR" indicates the balance is a Credit
      balance. If no "CR" appears, then the balance is a Debit balance.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>The Trial Balance query builder includes an option for displaying
      Accounts having a zero balance. If not selected, zero-balance Trial
      Balances will be hidden&mdash;unless a specific Account is specified, in
      which case the balance will be shown regardless of whether it is
      zero.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Also included is an option for showing Accounts with a Project
      Number as the last segment. If the "Show Project Detail" option is not
      used, balances will roll up into the parent Account total.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>If you are synchronizing the Trial Balances of multiple external
      Companies, you may get a warning message if Exchange Rates covering the
      imported Accounting Periods were changed after the fact. For more
      information, please see <xref linkend="syncCompanies" />.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>The option "Exclude Child Accounts" is available on the "G/L
      Transactions" screen whenever you are drilling down to view G/L
      transaction details. This option is used to show or hide the child
      transactions which may be associated with a G/L Account when Project
      Accounting is enabled.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>The following screenshot shows the "Trial Balances" screen:</para>

  Balances for the current Accounting Period. You can build your own search
  criteria using the following options:</para>
