  <para>This utility enables you to approve groups of shipped Orders for
  billing in one operation. When used, the full Order quantity of shipped
  Orders will be approved for billing. You may later change the billing
  details for individual line items using the right-click menu on the Billing
  Edit List. All approved Orders will appear on the Billing Edit List after
  the Approve Shipped Orders for Billing utility is run. This approach differs
  from the approach used by the Approve Order for Billing utility, which
  requires you to manually enter billing details for individual Orders. To
  approve multiple shipped Orders for billing, select the "Approve Shipped
  Orders for Billing" option. The following screen will appear:</para>
