  <para>Setting up the default account number structure is one of the primary
  purposes of the general ledger configuration. The system uses a
  multi-segment approach to defining general ledger (G/L) accounts. The
  various segments include the following:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Base account segment</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Company segment</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Profit center</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Subaccount</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>Depending on the parameters selected, the system will display G/L
  account numbers in the profit center-account number-subaccount sequence. An
  example of this sequence would be 001-11111-001.</para>
  <tip>
    <para>It is important to realize that the system does not utilize
    sub-accounts in the same manner that some other packaged software does. It
    does not roll-up into the base account, but allows you to define related
    accounts.</para>

  <para>To configure the general ledger, go to <guimenuitem>Accounting &gt;
  Setup</guimenuitem><guimenuitem>&gt; Configure
  &gt;</guimenuitem><guimenuitem> General Ledger</guimenuitem>. The following

  <para>When configuring the general ledger, you are presented with the
  following options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Use Company Segment</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to utilize a company segment in your G/L account numbers.
        This is an optional setting to be used if you are tracking account
        activity for multiple companies. Once transactions have been performed
        using this segment, the segment may not be disabled. If selected, the
        account assignments on this screen for retained earnings, G/L series
        discrepancy, and currency gain/loss will be disabled. You will need to
        make those account assignments on the Company screen. For more
        information, please see <xref linkend="company" />. To prevent
        unbalanced trial balances at the company level, G/L transactions and
        series postings will not be allowed that cross companies.</para>
        <note>
          <para>If prior to xTuple ERP 3.7.0 you were using the company
          segment for something other than separate company reporting—and you
          need to continue that usage—please contact your xTuple support
          representative.</para>

              should be. For example, if you specify "4" here, then your
              account numbers would probably range from 1000 through 9999.
              Similarly, if you specify "5" then your account number range

              transaction detail to be posted in real time to intermediate
              journals (sometimes also referred to as "day-books"). From the
              journals, transactions are later posted to the G/L—in summary
              form. In this way, transaction detail remains in the journals,
              with the summarized version of that detail residing in the G/L.
              You can post journals to the G/L on a daily, monthly, or weekly
              basis. It's up to you how you want to implement this feature.
              Keep in mind that the trial balance and other financial reports
              are based solely on G/L transactions. This means that journal
              transactions are not included in financial reports—that is,
              until they are posted over to the G/L. To learn more about
              posting journals to the G/L, please see <xref

              if retained earnings are negative. The retained earnings
              calculation occurs when a fiscal year is closed. Total expenses
              for the year are subtracted from total revenues, and the balance
              is transferred to the year end equity account. The system then
              automatically resets the beginning balances for revenue and
              expense accounts to $0 for the start of the new fiscal
              year.</para>

              credited for currency losses arising from fluctuating exchange
              rates. Currency gains/losses may be recognized at the following
              points: 1) When posting a cash receipt applied to an invoice; 2)
              when posting a payables payment applied to a voucher; 3) when
              applying a receivable misc. credit memo to an invoice; and 4)
              when applying a payables misc. credit memo to a voucher. In each
              case, the gain or loss arises when the exchange rate used for
              the apply-to document differs from the exchange rate used for
              the application.</para>

              will be debited or credited if rounding errors cause
              discrepancies when multiple line item (i.e., series)
              transactions are posted to the G/L. If used, the amounts posted
              to this account will be minuscule, as rounding errors are
              fractional by nature.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>Select a valid G/L account. This is a liability account.
              It will be debited or credited when the system cannot determine
              a ledger (or more typically a receivable/payable) account to
              distribute funds to. As a rule, there should be nothing in this
              account besides exceptions. The intention is that accountants
              should review the account monthly. If they find anything in the
              account, they should journal the amount out to the correct
              account(s) and fix the cause of the unassigned accounts.</para>
