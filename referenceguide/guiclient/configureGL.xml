  <para>Setting up the default Account Number structure is one of the primary
  purposes of the General Ledger Configuration. The system uses a
  multi-segment approach to defining General Ledger accounts. The various
  segments include the following:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Base Account Segment</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Company Segment</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Profit Center</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Subaccount</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>Depending on the parameters selected, the system will display General
  Ledger Account Numbers in the Profit Center-Account Number-Subaccount
  sequence. An example of this sequence would be 001-11111-001.</para>
  <tip>
    <para>It is important to realize that the system does not utilize
    sub-Accounts in the same manner that some other packaged software does. It
    does not roll-up into the base account, but allows you to define "related"
    Accounts.</para>
  </tip>
  <para>To configure the General Ledger, select the "General Ledger" tab. The
  following screen will appear:</para>

  <para>When configuring the General Ledger, you are presented with the
  following options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Use Company Segment</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to utilize a Company Segment in your G/L Account Numbers.
        This is an optional setting to be used if you are tracking Account
        activity for multiple Companies. If selected, the Account Assignments
        on this screen for retained earnings, G/L series discrepancy, and
        Currency gain/loss will be disabled. You will need to make those
        Account Assignments on the Company screen. For more information,
        please see <xref linkend="company" />. To prevent unbalanced Trial
        Balances at the Company level, G/L transactions and series postings
        will not be allowed that cross Companies.</para>
        <note>
          <para>If prior to xTuple ERP 3.7.0 you were using the Company
          segment for something other than separate Company
          reporting&mdash;and you need to continue that usage&mdash;please
          contact your xTuple support representative.</para>

              be. For example, if you specify "4" here, then your Account
              Numbers would probably range from 1000 through 9999. Similarly,
              if you specify "5" then your Account Number range would be from

              Journals (sometimes also referred to as "day books"). From the
              Journals, transactions are later posted to the General
              Ledger&mdash;in summary form. In this way, transaction detail
              remains in the Journals, with the summarized version of that
              detail residing in the General Ledger. You can post Journals to
              the General Ledger on a daily, monthly, or weekly basis. It's up
              to you how you want to implement this feature. Keep in mind that
              the trial balance and other financial reports are based solely
              on General Ledger transactions. This means that Journal
              transactions are not included in financial reports&mdash;that
              is, until they are posted over to the General Ledger. To learn
              more about posting Journals to the General Ledger, please see

              The retained earnings calculation occurs when a Fiscal Year is
              closed. Total Expenses for the year are subtracted from total
              Revenues, and the balance is transferred to the Year End Equity
              Account. The system then automatically resets the beginning
              balances for Revenue and Expense Accounts to $0 for the start of
              the new Fiscal Year.</para>

              Account only needed for xTuple ERP Databases where multiple

              gains and credited for Currency losses arising from fluctuating
              Exchange Rates. Currency gains/losses may be recognized at the
              following points: 1) When posting a Cash Receipt applied to an
              Invoice; 2) when posting a Payables Check applied to a Voucher;
              3) when applying a Receivable Misc. Credit Memo to an Invoice;
              and 4) when applying a Payables Misc. Credit Memo to a Voucher.
              In each case, the gain or loss arises when the Exchange Rate
              used for the Apply-To document differs from the Exchange Rate
              used for the application.</para>

              Account. It will be debited or credited if rounding errors cause
              discrepancies when multiple line item (i.e., series)
              transactions are posted to the General Ledger. If used, the
              amounts posted to this Account will be minuscule, as rounding

      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the number of buffer days you want to allow for when
        automatically processing recurring Vouchers. This setting is used by
        the Create Recurring Items utility, which is described in more detail
        here <xref linkend="createRecurringItems" />. Essentially, the buffer
        days setting tells the utility how far to look ahead. When it runs,
        the utility will create new Vouchers for any recurring Vouchers having
        Voucher dates within the look-ahead (i.e., buffer) days. If a Voucher
        date falls outside the buffer period, then no new Voucher will be
        created.</para>
