  <note>
    <para>An item's per unit actual cost will be automatically updated after a
    voucher is posted if the vouchered cost differs from the item's current
    actual cost. The vouchered cost for an item is determined by dividing the
    amount to distribute by the quantity to voucher.</para>
  </note>

  <para>When distributing purchasing costs to a specific costing element, you
  are presented with the following options:</para>

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Costing Element</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the costing element you want to distribute purchasing
        costs to. The material costing element will be selected by default
        once line item quantity has been tagged. You may distribute costs to
        more than one costing element per voucher item. The list of available
        costing elements includes the system-defined material costing element,
        as well as any user-defined costing elements designated as available
        to accept purchase order distributions.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>

  <tip>
    <para>Be sure to specify the amount to distribute based on the pricing
    found on the purchase order. The system will automatically handle any
    calculations required to accommodate inventory/vendor unit of measure
    (UOM) ratios which are not 1:1.</para>
  </tip>

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Amount to Distribute</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the purchasing amount to distribute to the specified
        costing element. By default, the extended price for the purchase order
        line item will be entered here once line item quantity has been
        tagged. Any difference between the distribution amount and the current
        actual cost amount for the costing element will result in the posting
        of automatic updates to the current actual cost when the voucher is
        posted.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Discountable</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>Select if the voucher item is entitled to a terms discount. This
        option may be used on a line-by-line basisâ€”all within one voucher. For
        example, purchased items may be discountable; however, freight charges
        may not be. When selecting a voucher for payment within the discount
        period, only discountable items will be discounted.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Notes</term>

      <listitem>
        <para>This is a scrolling text field with word-wrapping for entering
        general notes related to the voucher item distribution. These notes
        are for internal use only.</para>
