  <para>When creating a new Credit Memo Line Item, you are presented with the
  following options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Order #</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Displays the Credit Memo number for the current Credit

    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Item Number</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the Item Number of the Item you want to add to the Credit
        Memo. If the Credit Memo is being applied to an Invoice, only those
        Line Items which appeared on the Invoice will be available for
        selection&mdash;that is, if the appropriate setting is selected at the
        system level. Invoices are selected for application by a Credit Memo
        using the "Apply To" feature on the Credit Memo header screen.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <tip>
    <para>The system-level configuration which determines whether Credit Memo
    Items will be restricted to relevant Invoice Items is the setting
    "Restrict Credit Memos to Items that appear on their Apply-To Document."
    Selecting this option narrows the Credit Memo Item selection process to
    only those Items which appeared on the Invoice the Credit Memo is being
    applied to. If not selected, a sold Item master list will appear instead
    when selecting Credit Memo Items for Credit Memos applied to a specific
    Invoice. This setting has no bearing on unapplied Credit Memos.</para>

            <para>By default, the Reason Code on the Credit Memo header will

          <para>If the Credit Memo is created from a Return Authorization, the
          quantity returned will be zero on the Credit Memo Item screen.
          Return Authorization returns are handled separately, outside of the

        credit for. The quantity entered here may equal the quantity returned.
        However, you have the flexibility to credit the Customer for a
        quantity different from the returned quantity. The quantity credited
        is multiplied by the Net Unit Price to determine the amount of the
        credit.</para>

        </indexterm>Net Unit Price</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the Net Unit Price to assign the quantity being
        credited. If the Credit Memo is being applied to a specific Invoice,
        then the system will automatically enter the Item's Net Unit Price as
        it appeared on the referring Invoice. If no Invoice is being
        applied-to, then the system will choose the lower of the following two
        Prices: A) The most-specific Pricing Schedule Assignment or B) any
        Sale in effect at the time of Order entry. The specificity of Pricing
        Schedule Assignments is determined in the following descending order:
        By Customer Ship-To Address (most specific), by Customer, by Customer
        Type, by Customer Type pattern, by all Customers. The lookup feature
        located to the right of the field leads to a Price List screen.</para>
        <para>If your Pricing Schedule has multiple Units of Measure (UOM) on
        it (or if several Pricing Schedules share the same level of Price
        specificity, but they have different UOMs) then the UOM which matches
        the selected UOM will be chosen&mdash;that is, as long as the quantity
        break does not exceed the quantity being priced. If no entry matches
        the UOM with a quantity break less than the quantity being priced,
        then the lowest value Price for any UOM will be chosen. To make sure a
        specific UOM is always chosen at the desired level of Price
        specificity, then your Pricing Schedules should include at least one
        UOM with a quantity break of 0.</para>
        <tip>
          <para>The system can be configured to prevent users from editing the
          Net Unit Price. If your system is configured that way, the Net Unit
          Price field will not be editable.</para>
