  <para>When creating a new Sales Credit Line Item, you are presented with the

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Sales Credit #</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Displays the Sales Credit number for the current Sales
        Credit.</para>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Item Type</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Indicate the Item Type for the Sales Credit Line Item, by
        selecting one of the following options:</para>
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>Item</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>The lookup feature located to the right of the field leads
              to a searchable list of Inventory Items. If the Sales Credit is
              being applied to a particular Invoice―and your Sales module is
              configured to restrict Sales Credits to Items appearing on their
              apply-to document―then the Item list will show only Items on the
              original Invoice. The ITEM/ALIAS SEARCH button can also be used
              to help locate Sales Credit Items. Once an Item Number is
              entered, the Inventory Unit of Measure and Item description will
              automatically appear. Additionally, you may also specify the
              Item's receiving Site. Commercial editions of xTuple allow Items
              to be received into multiple Sites.</para>

            <term>Miscellaneous</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>Enter a name and description for the miscellaneous,
              non-Inventory Item you are billing the Customer for. The name
              and description fields are free-form, meaning they accept
              unlimited alphanumeric characters. You must also select a Sales
              Category. Sales Categories are used to identify the General
              Ledger (G/L) Accounts to be used when non-Inventory Sales
              transactions take place.</para>

            <para>By default, the Reason Code on the Sales Credit header will

            Code for individual Line Items.</para>

      <term>Alternate Revenue Account</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify an alternate Account to be used as the Revenue Account.
        This account will be used instead of the typical Accounts pre-defined
        in the Receivables Assignments. For example, you might use this
        alternate Account in the scenario where you are doing business with
        Customers who are part of the same buyer's group (i.e., Customer
        Group).</para>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Qty. Returned</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the quantity of the Item returned for credit. If the Sales
        Credit was created from a Return Authorization, the quantity returned
        will be zero on the Sales Credit Item screen. Return Authorization
        returns are handled separately, outside of the normal Sales Credit
        Inventory handling process.</para>

              into Inventory when you post the Sales Credit. If not selected,
              your Inventory will not be updated.</para>

      <term>Qty. To Credit</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the quantity of the Item you plan to give the Customer
        credit for. The quantity entered here may equal the quantity returned.
        However, you have the flexibility to credit the Customer for a
        quantity different from the returned quantity. The quantity credited
        is multiplied by the Net Unit Price to determine the amount of the
        credit.</para>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Qty UOM</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>The unit of measure being returned and credited in. You may also

      <term>Discount % from Sale</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify a percentage to reduce the credited amount by. The
        discount will be deducted from the sale Price, thereby reducing the
        amount of the credit by the specified percentage.</para>

        </indexterm>Net Unit Price</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the Net Unit Price to assign the quantity being
        credited. If the Sales Credit is being applied to a specific Invoice,
        then the system will automatically enter the Item's Net Unit Price as
        it appeared on the referring Invoice. If no Invoice is being
        applied-to, then the system will choose the lower of the following two
        Prices: A) The most-specific Pricing Schedule Assignment or B) any
        Sale in effect at the time of Order entry. The specificity of Pricing
        Schedule Assignments is determined in the following descending order:
        By Customer Ship-To Address (most specific), by Customer, by Customer
        Type, by Customer Type pattern, by all Customers. The lookup feature
        located to the right of the field leads to a Price List screen.</para>
        <para>If your Pricing Schedule has multiple Units of Measure (UOM) on
        it (or if several Pricing Schedules share the same level of Price
        specificity, but they have different UOMs) then the UOM which matches
        the selected UOM will be chosen—that is, as long as the quantity break
        does not exceed the quantity being priced. If no entry matches the UOM
        with a quantity break less than the quantity being priced, then the
        lowest value Price for any UOM will be chosen. To make sure a specific
        UOM is always chosen at the desired level of Price specificity, then
        your Pricing Schedules should include at least one UOM with a quantity
        break of 0.</para>
        <tip>
          <para>The system can be configured to prevent users from editing the
          Net Unit Price. If your system is configured that way, the Net Unit
          Price field will not be editable.</para>
