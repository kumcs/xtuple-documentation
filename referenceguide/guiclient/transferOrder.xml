  <para>Transfer Orders are used to move Inventory between Sites. They are
  distinct from Inter-Site Transfers in three primary ways: 1) you can add
  multiple Items to a single Transfer Order and transfer all the Items at
  once; 2) all Transfer Order transfers involve a Transit Site, for tracking
  Inventory while it is "in transit"; and 3) there are reports (i.e.,
  paperwork) associated with Transfer Orders. To enter a new Transfer Order,
  select the "New Transfer Order" option. The following screen will
  appear:</para>

        <para>Displays the Order's earliest scheduled date. The scheduled date
        corresponds to the earliest scheduled date for an included Transfer
        Order Item. Because Transfer Orders may contain multiple Transfer
        Order Items, the scheduled date indicates the most recent scheduled
        date. No scheduled date will display in the "Scheduled Date" field
        until a Transfer Order Line Item has been created and a scheduled date
        assigned to it.</para>

        ReleaseTransferOrders privilege is required to change the status to
        Open. The Transfer Order must be released before shipping and
        receiving transactions are allowed. Changing the order status will
        also make the appropriate status changes to the order line
