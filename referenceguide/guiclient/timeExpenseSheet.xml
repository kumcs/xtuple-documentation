  <para>The Time and Expense Sheet is the weekly container for holding time
  and expenses entered by Employees. As Employees enter time and expense
  sheets during the course of a week, the Time and Expense Sheet organizes
  those entries. When the next week arrives, a new Time and Expense Sheet is
  created and Employee time and expense entries are contained there.
  Typically, Time and Expense Sheets are approved on a weekly basis.</para>
  <para>To review an already-existing Time and Expense Sheet, select the EDIT
  option on the main Time and Expense Sheets workbench. The following screen
  will appear:</para>
