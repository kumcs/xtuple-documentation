  <title>Billing Selections</title>
  <para>To edit Orders selected for billing and to create Invoices for these
  Orders, select the "Billing Selections" option. The following screen will
  appear:</para>

    </screenshot></para>
  <para>The Billing Selections list displays Orders selected for
  billing.</para>
  <tip>
    <para>Because less detailed information is shown, the Billing Selections
    list will load more quickly than the Billing Edit List. The amount of
    detail is the only difference between the two lists. Both show the same
    Orders selected for billing.</para>
  </tip>
  <para>The following buttons are unique to this screen:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>CREATE ALL</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to create Invoices for all Orders on the list.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <note>
    <para>When you convert an Order selected for billing to an Invoice, you
    create an unposted Invoice. Unposted Invoices must in turn be posted to
    generate associated General Ledger (G/L) transaction records. You can
    reverse the process of Invoice creation by deleting the unposted
    Invoice.</para>
