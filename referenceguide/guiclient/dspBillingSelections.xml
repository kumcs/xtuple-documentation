  <title>Billing Approvals</title>
  <para>When you convert an order selected for billing to an invoice, you
  create an unposted invoice. Unposted invoices must in turn be posted to
  generate associated general ledger (G/L) transaction records. You can
  reverse the process of invoice creation by deleting the unposted invoice. To
  edit orders selected for billing and to create invoices for these orders,
  select the "Billing Approvals" option. The following screen will
  appear:</para>

  <para>The billing Approvals list displays orders selected for
  billing.</para>
  <tip>
    <para>Because less detailed information is shown, the billing Approvals
    list will load more quickly than the billing Edit List. The amount of
    detail is the only difference between the two lists. Both show the same
    orders selected for billing.</para>
