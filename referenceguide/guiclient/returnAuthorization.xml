  <para>Many users of xTuple ERP have a company policy to accept returned
  goods. To adequately handle this situation they need a mechanism to keep a
  record of what goods have been authorized for a return, credit, or other
  disposition. A Return Authorization is an internal approval system to
  resolve a problem resulting from dissatisfaction with products or services
  shipped. Depending on the business model, users may handle the return in a
  number of ways. The xTuple ERP return system is flexible enough to handle
  the needs of most business scenarios.</para>
  <para>To access the Return Authorization window, Return Authorizations must
  be enabled in Sales Configuration. A Return Authorization appears as

      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the date when the Return Authorization will expire. This

        should pass before the transactions on the Return Authorization are
        considered past due. When used, Return Authorizations cannot be

        Customer masterâ€”either by a default setting or through the assignment
        of Ship-To Addresses. Each Ship-To Address may have a different sales
        representative associated with it. Consequently, the name of the sales
        representative appearing on the Return Authorization header will be
        the same as specified for the Ship-To Address being used.</para>
