  <para>Many users of xTuple ERP have a company policy to accept returned
  goods. To adequately handle this situation they need a mechanism to keep a
  record of what goods have been authorized for a return, credit, or other
  disposition. A Return Authorization is an internal approval system to
  resolve a problem resulting from dissatisfaction with products or services
  shipped. Depending on the business model, users may handle the return in a
  number of ways. The xTuple ERP return system is flexible enough to handle
  the needs of most business scenarios.</para>
  <para>To access the Return Authorization window, Return Authorizations must
  be enabled in Sales Configuration. A Return Authorization appears as

        should pass before the transactions on the Return Authorization are
        considered past due. When used, Return Authorizations cannot be

        of Ship-To Addresses. Each Ship-To Address may have a different sales
        representative associated with it. Consequently, the name of the sales
        representative appearing on the Return Authorization header will be
        the same as specified for the Ship-To Address being used.</para>
