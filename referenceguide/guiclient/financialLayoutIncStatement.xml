  <para>The system ships with a basic Income Statement designed to generate
  Financial Reports using your Revenue and Expense Account data. In this
  section, we will examine this basic Income Statement.</para>
  <note>
    <para>Because the basic Income Statement is a system-defined Financial
    Report, it may not be modified (except to make it active or inactive).
    However, you may copy the report and modify the copy. You can think of the
    basic Income Statement as a template for building other, similar Financial
    Reports.</para>
    <para role="xtprjaccnt">If the xTuple Project Accounting package is
    installed, the basic Income Statement will be available to
    Projects.</para>
  </note>
  <para>To view the basic Income Statement, select it for editing from the
  master list of Financial Reports. A message will alert you that this is a
  system-defined report which may only be viewed, not edited. Select the OK
  button to reach the following screen:</para>

  <para>The "Row Layout" tab displays information on all the Account Groups
  and Account Numbers which make up the basic Income Statement. If this were a
  custom report you were creating, you would be able to add/remove Account
  Groups and Account Numbers to meet your specific needs.</para>
  <tip>
    <para>To build row layouts for the three standard report
    types&mdash;Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow&mdash;use the
    same techniques as when building Ad Hoc report row layouts. The only
    difference is you won"t need to specify which balances to calculate (e.g.,
    beginning, ending, etc.). The system determines which calculations will be
    done for the standard statement formats.</para>
  </tip>
  <para>When viewing row layouts for the basic Income Statement, you are
  presented with the following columns:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Group/Account Name</emphasis>: Lists the
      Account Groups and Account Types used in the report. The two main groups
      are REVENUE and EXPENSES. All Accounts having Type=Revenue are included
      in the REVENUE group. And within the EXPENSES group all Accounts having
      Type=Expense are included.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Sub./Summ.</emphasis>: Indicates whether
      group information will be presented as a subtotal or summary line when
      the report is run. In the basic Income Statement, all Account Groups are
      subtotaled.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Oper.</emphasis>: Specifies whether a group
      will be added to ("+") or subtracted from ("-") the group total. In the
      basic Income Statement, REVENUE is added to and EXPENSES are subtracted
      from the INCOME group.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <note>
    <para>Select the VIEW button to see the system-defined settings for each
    Account Group and Account Type used in the basic Income Statement. When
    creating your own reports, you may choose to either imitate or alter these
    default settings.</para>
  </note>
  <para>In addition to row layouts, you may also define column layouts for
  your Financial Reports. Column layouts are used to specify the time buckets
  financial information will be sorted into. You specify a column layout to
  use when viewing or printing Financial Reports. You may define any number of
  column layouts. Each layout will be linked to either a pre-defined report
  definition or a custom report definition you create yourself.</para>
  <para>On the basic Income Statement, select the "Column Layouts" tab to view
  all the time buckets available for the report. If this were a custom report
  you were creating, you would be able to add/remove column layouts to meet
  your specific needs.</para>
