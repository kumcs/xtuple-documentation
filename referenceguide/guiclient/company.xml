  <para>If you need to track and report on Account activity for multiple
  Companies&mdash;or if you are consolidating external Companies into your
  parent xTuple Database&mdash;then you will need to define Company
  information on this screen. To prevent unbalanced Trial Balances at the
  Company level, G/L transactions and series postings will not be allowed that
  cross Companies.</para>
  <note>
    <para>If prior to xTuple ERP 3.7.0 you were using the Company segment for
    something other than separate Company reporting&mdash;and you need to
    continue that usage&mdash;please contact your xTuple support
    representative.</para>

  <para>When creating a new Company, you are presented with the following
  options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Number</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter a number to identify the Company.</para>

      <term>Description</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter a brief description of the Company.</para>

    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Retained Earnings</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select a valid General Ledger Account. This is an Equity
        Account. It will be credited if retained earnings are
        positive&mdash;and debited if retained earnings are negative. The
        retained earnings calculation occurs when a Fiscal Year is closed.
        Total Expenses for the year are subtracted from total Revenues, and
        the balance is transferred to the Year End Equity Account. The system
        then automatically resets the beginning balances for Revenue and
        Expense Accounts to $0 for the start of the new Fiscal Year.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Currency Gain/Loss</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select a valid General Ledger Account. This is an Expense
        Account only needed for xTuple ERP Databases where multiple Currencies
        are in use. The Account will debited for Currency gains and credited
        for Currency losses arising from fluctuating Exchange Rates. Currency
        gains/losses may be recognized at the following points: 1) When
        posting a Cash Receipt applied to an Invoice; 2) when posting a
        Payables Check applied to a Voucher; 3) when applying a Receivable
        Misc. Credit Memo to an Invoice; and 4) when applying a Payables Misc.
        Credit Memo to a Voucher. In each case, the gain or loss arises when
        the Exchange Rate used for the Apply-To document differs from the
        Exchange Rate used for the application.</para>

    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>G/L Series Discrepancy</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select a valid General Ledger Account. This is an Expense
        Account. It will be debited or credited if rounding errors cause
        discrepancies when multiple line item (i.e., series) transactions are
        posted to the General Ledger. If used, the amounts posted to this
        Account will be minuscule, as rounding errors are fractional by
        nature.</para>

    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry role="standard">
      <term>External Company</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to designate the Company as a pointer to a Company on
        another database. This option will only be visible if external Company
        consolidation is enabled in the system's Accounting configuration.
        This option is also available only on xTuple ERP Standard Edition and
        higher.</para>
