  <para>Characteristics may be used to create additional layers of information
  about Items, Customers, CRM Accounts, and more. For example, Characteristics
  defined on an Item master may be associated with Sales Order Items. And, if
  the Sales Order leads to the automatic generation of additional Orders
  (i.e., Work Orders or Purchase Orders), then the subsequent Orders will
  inherit the parent Sales Order Characteristics.</para>
  <para>To access the master list of Characteristics, select the
  "Characteristics" option. The following screen will appear.</para>
