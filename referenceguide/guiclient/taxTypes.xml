  <para>Tax types provide a system for classifying goods and services into
  taxable categories. The primary implementation of tax types is on the Item
  master, where items may be linked to tax types. For example, if you have a
  tax type called "Taxable," you would want to associate this tax type with
  all your taxable items. The tax type makes up one third of the three-way
  match on tax assignments, which includes tax zone, tax code, and tax type.
  When all three of these match for a particular order, then tax will be
  calculated appropriately.</para>
  <note>
    <para>If you need to calculate tax on freight, make sure that your tax
    assignment matrix includes a match using the system-defined Freight tax
    type.</para>
