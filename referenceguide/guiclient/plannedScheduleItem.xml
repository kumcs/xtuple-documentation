  <tip>
    <para>You can reduce clutter (and simplify) your production Plans by
    taking advantage of the Planning Item type. A Planning item is an item
    whose bill of materials (BOM) groups together other items so that a
    production Plan may be defined for the Planning itemâ€”and then exploded
    down to the lower level items during a Master production Scheduling (MPS)
    run. Planning items are frequently used to group together product families
    or product lines of MPS items.</para>
  </tip>
  <para>When creating a new production Plan item, you are presented with the
  following options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Item Number</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the item number of the item you want to add to the
        production Plan. You may only add items whose item site is
        specifically linked to the MPS Planning system. See the "Planning" tab
        on the Item Site screen. Use the lookup feature located to the right
        of the field to reach a searchable MPS items list.</para>

    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Planned Date</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the date when the specified item quantity will be
        required. When MPS is run, the system will look at the planned date
        for production Plan items. If a planned date falls within the cutoff
        date for the MPS run, the system will plan for the demand accordingly.
        If the planned date falls beyond the cutoff date, the demand will be
        ignored.</para>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Qty.</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the demand quantity for the production Plan item. In the
        case of a Planning item, the quantity entered here will have a ripple
        effect on any component items listed on the planning item's bill of
        materials.</para>
