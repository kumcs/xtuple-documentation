  <title>New Production Plan</title>

  <para>Production plans are used for loading sales forecasts into the system.
  These forecasts are then accounted for when the master production scheduling
  (MPS) system is run. Firm planned orders may be created for items listed on
  production plans as the result of an MPS run. To create a new production
  plan, go to <guimenuitem>Schedule &gt; Production Plan &gt;
  New</guimenuitem>. The following screen will appear:</para>

              <para>Planning items having this schedule type are not taken
              into account by MPS. Instead, use this schedule type for
              reporting purposes only, such as the reporting found on the MPS
              Detail screen. Forecast reporting can be useful as a reference
              of progress against cumulative MPS schedules, usually in
              scenarios where demand is discontinuous or
              <emphasis>lumpy</emphasis>, but production schedules are
              continuous.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>Used for forecast reporting and netted as demand to
              existing supply by the MPS processor for items scheduled inside
              the demand time fence. Use where you desire supply to
              automatically be created to fulfill, but not exceed, the greater
              of forecasted and actual demand. Inside the demand time fence,
              MPS ignores the forecast and plans an amount based on actual
              demand net of projected availability. Outside of the demand time
              fence, MPS uses the larger of actual demand or the forecast and
              nets this against projected availability.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>Cumulative schedules allow the forced accumulation of
              inventory in a discontinuous or lumpy demand situation where
              load leveling or continuous production is desired. With this
              setting, MPS may release more, but never less, than the quantity
              dictated in a cumulative MPS schedule. Inside the demand time
              fence, cumulative schedules are ignoredâ€”and only actual demand
              is considered. Outside the demand time fence, planned orders for
              cumulative schedules are created per the greater of schedule
              quantity or net actual demand. The system interprets
              <emphasis>net actual demand</emphasis> to mean that it will use,
              for a given period, the larger of A) cumulative schedule
              quantity or B) quantity required to accommodate time-phased
              availability (i.e., QOH + qty. on order - allocations).</para>
