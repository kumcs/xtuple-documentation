  <title>New Production Plan</title>
  <para>Production Plans are used for loading sales Forecasts into the system.
  These Forecasts are then accounted for when the Master Production Scheduling
  (MPS) system is run. Firm Planned Orders may be created for Items listed on
  Production Plans as the result of an MPS run. To create a new Production
  Plan, select the NEW button. The following screen will appear:</para>

  <para>When creating a new Production Plan you are presented with the

        <para>Select one of the available Production Plan schedule
        types:</para>

          </indexterm> <indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>forecast</primary>
            <secondary>reporting for mps</secondary>
          </indexterm>Forecast Reporting: Planning Items having this schedule
        type are not taken into account by MPS. Instead, use this schedule
        type for reporting purposes only, such as the reporting found on the
        MPS Detail screen. Forecast reporting can be useful as a reference of
        progress against Cumulative MPS Schedules, usually in scenarios where
        demand is discontinuous or "lumpy," but production schedules are
        continuous.</para>
        <para>Forecast Netted to MPS: Used for forecast reporting and netted
        as demand to existing supply by the MPS processor for Items scheduled
        inside the Demand Time Fence. Use where you desire supply to
        automatically be created to fulfill, but not exceed, the greater of
        forecasted and actual demand. Inside the Demand Time Fence, MPS
        ignores the forecast and plans an amount based on actual demand net of
        projected Availability. Outside of the Demand Time Fence, MPS uses the
        larger of actual demand or the forecast and nets this against
        projected Availability.</para>
        <para><indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>mps</primary>
            <secondary>cumulative schedules and</secondary>

            <primary>cumulative schedules</primary>
            <secondary>explained</secondary>
          </indexterm>Cumulative MPS: Cumulative Schedules allow the forced
        accumulation of inventory in a discontinuous or "lumpy" demand
        situation where load leveling or continuous production is desired.
        With this setting, MPS may release more, but never less, than the
        quantity dictated in a Cumulative MPS Schedule. Inside the Demand Time
        Fence, Cumulative Schedules are ignoredâ€”and only actual demand is
        considered. Outside the Demand Time Fence, Planned Orders for
        Cumulative Schedules are created per the greater of schedule quantity
        or net actual demand. The system interprets "net actual demand" to
        mean that it will use, for a given period, the larger of A) Cumulative
        Schedule quantity or B) quantity required to accommodate time-phased
        Availability (i.e., QOH + Qty. On Order - Allocations).</para>

    Plans will be ignored by MPS when it is run.</para>
