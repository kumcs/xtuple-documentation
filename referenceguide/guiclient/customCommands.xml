  <para>If you want to execute external programs from within the menu
  structure, you can do so using the Custom Commands utility. This utility
  enables you to create custom menu options, which users may then select to
  launch specified programs. Custom Commands are well-suited for running
  custom reports. However, they may be used to execute a wide range of
  programs, for a variety of purposes. To access the master list of Custom
  Commands, select the "Custom Commands" option. The following screen will
  appear:</para>
