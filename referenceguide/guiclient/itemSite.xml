  <para>An Item Site identifies and defines the methods and controls used when
  maintaining a given Item within a given Site. To enter a new Item Site into

        apply to manual Orders, but to Planned Orders only. When a maximum
        Order quantity is specified, MRP will ignore Order multiples and
        minimum Order specifications—focusing instead solely on the maximum
        Order setting. For example, if the maximum Order quantity is set to 10
        and there is demand for 17, then Planned Orders of 10 and 7 would be
        generated when MRP is run.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the length of a period—measured in days—within which MPS
        or MRP Planned Orders will be grouped together (i.e, consolidated) to
        meet scheduled demand for the period. This functionality serves to
        limit the total number of Planned Orders, thereby simplifying order
        processing. For example, to consolidate demand for an Item Site into
        30-day buckets, set the value to "30." When MRP is run, the system
        will automatically consolidate all demand falling within the 30-day
        horizon into a single Planned Purchase Order or Planned Work Order.
        The grouping of Planned Orders moves forward in time, meaning the
        system will create as many buckets as will fit within the cutoff date
        specified when MRP is run.</para>
        <para>The initial grouping of Planned Orders is handled differently

        Demand Time Fence (also known as the demand fence) is used by the
        Master Production Scheduling (MPS) system to evaluate when forecasted
        demand (i.e., from Production Plans) should be used in place of actual
        demand (i.e., from Sales Orders)—and vice versa. Measured in days, the
        Demand Time Fence is the period of time extending from the current day
        to the number of days into the future as specified in this field. The
        Demand Time Fence option applies only to those Items which currently
        appear on a released Production Plan. If demand for these Items falls
        within the Demand Time Fence period, then the Forecast will be
        ignored. If demand falls outside the Demand Time Fence, then the
        larger of actual or forecasted demand will be used. MPS responds to

        Safety Stock is below the Reorder Level, then Planned Orders will be
        created. If not below the Reorder Level, then no Planned Orders will
        be created. The system's calculation effectively creates a buffer
        Inventory (if needed) to handle unexpected fluctuations in demand. If
