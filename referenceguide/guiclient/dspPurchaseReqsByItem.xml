    <para>Purchase Requests may be created using the right-click menus
    available in several displays. For example, you can generate Purchase
    Requests from Inventory Availability and also Planned Order
    reports.</para>

  <para>When displaying Purchase Requests by Item, you are presented with the
  following options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Item Number</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the Item Number of the Item whose Purchase Requests you
        want to view. The lookup feature located to the right of the field
        leads to a searchable list of make and buy items.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>UOM</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Inventory Unit of Measure.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <note>
    <para>Purchase Request quantities are based on the Inventory Unit of
    Measure (UOM). However, some Vendor Item Sources may specify an alternate
    UOM. If this is the case, the system will automatically convert the
    requirement to the Vendor's UOM when the Purchase Request is
    released.</para>

    <varlistentry role="standard">
      <term>All Sites</term>
      <listitem>

        the specified parameters.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <note>
    <para>When a Purchase Request is released, the requested Item will
    automatically populate a Purchase Order Item screen. If Item Sources have
    been defined for the Item, then Item Source Prices will be usedâ€”that is,
    unless the Vendor price has been specifically overridden for Purchase
    Requests generated from Sales Orders. Project Numbers may also be
    transferred from Sales Orders. In this way, Sales Orders and Purchase
    Order Line Items may be linked to the same Project.</para>
