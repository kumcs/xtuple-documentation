Installing xTuple Client Help Files
==================================================
Last Updated 03/11/08


xTuple Clients feature a Help menu on the main menu bar. From this Help
menu, users may access on-line documentation--that is, assuming the 
required help files have also been installed. The process for installing 
help files differs depending on the type of client you are using. See
below for instructions on how to install help files for the various 
platforms supported by xTuple.


Client for Windows
------------------
You must first locate the directory where you installed your 'xtuple.exe' 
file. xtuple.exe is the main xTuple application file. Among the various
other files in this directory, you should see a file called 'assistant.exe'
and a directory called 'helpXTupleGUIClient'. The assistant.exe file
is the program xTuple uses to display on-line help. The helpXTupleGUIClient
directory contains the necessary help content files. 

If your installation does not include these files, then you should download
a new copy of the xTuple client. The assistant.exe file is included with 
current releases of the software. To get the needed help content files, you
should download the 'helpXTupleGUIClient.zip' file from the xTuple website.
This .zip file contains the help content files. Be sure When extracting the 
.zip file to choose the appropriate options to ensure you maintain the 
directory structure for the help files. If extracted correctly, a directory 
called 'helpXTupleGUIClient' will be installed at the same level as the
xtuple.exe file. This directory will contain the help content files.

As long as the assistant.exe file and the help content files directory are 
installed as described above, you may access on-line documentation using the 
Help menu found within the xTuple client.


Client for Mac
--------------
The xTuple application for Mac is distributed as a package. To view the 
contents of the xTuple package, hold down the CTRL key on your keyboard and 
then click on the package file. From the pop-up menu, select the 'Show 
Package Contents' option. An application file called 'assistant' should be
located in the Contents\Resources directory. The assistant file is the program 
xTuple uses to display on-line help.

Once you have verified the assistant program is installed in the Contents\
Resources directory, you must then install the help content files into the
same directory. To do so, download the 'helpXTupleGUIClient.zip' file from
the xTuple website. This .zip file contains the help content files. Be sure
When extracting the .zip file to choose the appropriate options to ensure you
maintain the directory structure for the help files. If extracted correctly,
a directory called 'helpXTupleGUIClient' will be installed in the Contents\
Resources directory. This directory will contain the help content files.

As long as the assistant file and the help content files directory are 
installed as described above, you may access on-line documentation using the 
Help menu found within the xTuple client.


Client for Linux
----------------
Follow the same process as for the Client for Windows. The only difference is
the main xTuple application and assistant files will not have the '.exe'
extension.
