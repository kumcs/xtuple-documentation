Release Notes
xTuple ERP
Version 4.0.0Beta3
November 26, 2012
==================================

The following features and bug fixes have been added to the
applications since 4.0.0Beta2. Additional detail for each item
listed below may be found on our community website under the
Issue Tracker.

PLEASE NOTE: Any testers with 4.0.0Alpha or 4.0.0Beta databases
may experience errors when upgrading to 4.0.0Beta2, due to an 
issue (#18078) with the upgrade scripts. If you encounter this
problem, the solution is to start fresh with a new instance of
your 4.0.0Alpha database--and then migrate that forward to
4.0.0Beta2. You should download a new version of the
pb400alphato400beta.gz or std400alphato400beta.gz upgrade script
before upgrading, as these files have been updated since the
official release date.

ALSO NOTE: If you are starting with a 3.8.2, 3.8.3, or 3.8.4
database, you may hit issue #18077. In this case, change the
"ServerVersion" metric to "3.8.0" in your database and try
upgrading again. If that doesn't work, try using the auxiliary
pre-upgrade package attached to issue #18077. This problem will 
be fixed in the upgrade packages from 3.8.x to 4.0.0RC and 
4.0.0(final).
