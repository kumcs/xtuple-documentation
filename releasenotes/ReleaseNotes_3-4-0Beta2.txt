Release Notes
xTuple ERP
PostBooks, Standard, and Manufacturing Editions
Version 3.4.0Beta2
November 18, 2009
==================================

This is the second Beta release in the 3.4.0 cycle. Thanks
to all for your feedback on the first Beta. This release builds
on the testing results from the first Beta and also includes
a number of other bug fixes.

Relatively few new features have been included. However, of special 
note is the new "Enforce Valid Country Names" option we've added 
to the CRM configuration screen. When selected, this option requires
all country names in the database to conform to standard naming
conventions. While this feature is optional, we are also issuing
a free packaged utility called "fixCountry.gz" to help users clean
up any non-conforming country names in their data. Like any other
package, the fixCountry.gz utility can be loaded using the Updater. 
If you are interested in this new functionality, please test it out
in this second Beta--and send us any feedback you may have.

NOTE: If you are upgrading your database to version 3.4.0Beta2, you
must use the new Updater, version 2.2.0Beta.

The following features and bug fixes have been added to the
