Release Notes
xTuple ERP
PostBooks, Standard, and Manufacturing Editions
Version 3.5.0Beta
February 12, 2010
==================================

This is the first beta release in the 3.5.0 release cycle. Anyone
who has not registered yet for haxTuple (our 2d annual bug
derby), there's still time to get involved. The contest runs from
February 15th to March 8th. Learn more about the rules and the
prizes being offered here: http://www.xtuple.org/haxtuple-2010

Of course, you don't have to be a developer to get involved.
We are also looking for feedback from community beta testers. So
load up your sandboxes and test away! NOTE: If you are testing
the Manufacturing Edition, the upgrade from 3.5.0Alpha to 
3.5.0Beta does not require an upgrade script for the xtmfg
package--only the std350alphato350beta.gz script is required.

Sure to be of interest to everyone are the new enhancements to
the virtual (search) cluster. Beginning with 3.5.0Beta, users
will find auto-complete functionality in lookup fields
throughout the applications. Legacy lookup buttons will still be
supported. But auto-recognition of partially-entered strings
is now supported.

Also, don't forget to check out and test the new features
introduced in the alpha:
