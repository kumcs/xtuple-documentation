Release Notes
xTuple ERP
Version 4.0.0Beta2
August 1, 2012
==================================

This is the second beta release of version 4.0.0. This release 
includes several new features and bug fixes. As always, we are 
looking for feedback from beta testers. However, if you do test 
the beta, please be reminded beta software should not be used 
in live production.

PLEASE NOTE: Any testers with 4.0.0Alpha or 4.0.0Beta databases
may experience errors when upgrading to 4.0.0Beta2, due to an 
issue (#18078) with one of the commercial upgrade scripts. If you
encounter this problem, the solution is to start fresh with a 
new instance of your 4.0.0Alpha database--and then migrate that
forward to 4.0.0Beta2.

Information about compatibility issues related to this software
version can be found on the xTuple Compatibility Matrix at the
following address: www.xtuple.org/compatibility-matrix.
