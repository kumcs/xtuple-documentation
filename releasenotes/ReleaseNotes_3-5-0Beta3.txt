Release Notes
xTuple ERP
PostBooks, Standard, and Manufacturing Editions
Version 3.5.0Beta2
March 3, 2010
==================================

This is the second beta release in the 3.5.0 release cycle. If
you've been following our community site, you know our haxTuple
bug derby is well under way, with several community members
currently vying for the top prizes. If you have not registered
yet for haxTuple, there's still time to get involved. The contest
runs from February 15th to March 8th. Learn more about the rules
and the prizes being offered here: http://www.xtuple.org/haxtuple-2010

Of course, you don't have to be a developer to get involved.
We are also looking for feedback from community beta testers. So
load up your sandboxes and test away! NOTE: If you are testing
the Manufacturing Edition, the upgrade from 3.5.0Alpha to
3.5.0Beta does not require an upgrade script for the xtmfg
package--only the std350alphato350beta.gz script is required.

Sure to be of interest to everyone are the new enhancements to
the virtual (search) cluster. Beginning with 3.5.0Beta, users
will find auto-complete functionality in lookup fields
throughout the applications. Legacy lookup buttons will still be
supported. But auto-recognition of partially-entered strings
is now supported.

In this release look for the debut of the new "Parameter Widget" in
the To-Do List and Incident Workbench windows. This new widget
allows programmers to define unlimited possible filter criteria on a
report as list of parameter types (i.e. CRM Account, Contact Name,
Start Date, User Name) rather than as a fixed collection of widgets
laid out on the screen as we have traditionally done. Users can then
dynamically select from this list and build filter combination
criteria to apply to their query which they can save for future use.
Expect to see this methodology deployed throughout the application in
future releases.

Here is a list of new features to check out in 3.5.0:

Drop Ship Purchasing
  * Full spec: http://www.xtuple.org/node/2481

Expanded Pricing Effectivity Support
  * More info: http://www.xtuple.org/issuetracker/view.php?id=9603

Embedded MetaSQL Editor
  * More info: http://www.xtuple.org/issuetracker/view.php?id=7732

Tooling Management
  * Full spec: http://www.xtuple.org/node/2197

Also of note:

  * Improved Lot/Serial Support
  * Support for Postgres 8.4
