Release Notes
xTuple ERP
OpenMFG/Standard Edition/PostBooks
Version 3.0.0Beta
May 23, 2008
==================================

This is the first Beta release of version 3.0.0. Thanks to all who
provided feedback on the Alpha release over the past week. 

The 3.0.0 release contains a number of significant new features. As
always, we are very interested to hear from beta testers who may be 
seeing this new functionality for the first time. So please 
download and use the beta--and send us your feedback!

Here's a summary of the major new features:

Form Builder

  You can now make small changes to existing windows and add new windows
  to the application without learning C++.  A Design submenu has been
  added to the System menu which lets you load Qt User Interface files
  into the database, create menu items to trigger those UI files, and
  write JavaScript to run against either these new UI files or when the
  application loads precompiled windows. You will need Qt Designer to
  create the new UI files; if you want to use xTuple's custom widgets in
  your UI files then you will need to install a development environment
  to build the widgets library.

Assemble To Order (ATO) Configurator

  It is now possible to configure non-Inventory Items--namely Job Type
  and Reference Type Items. Configuration begins at the Item level, 
  where List Prices may be associated with Characteristics. When these 
  Characteristics are selected at Sales Order Item entry, the Line Item 
  Price is incremented accordingly. Likewise, Item Characteristics for 
  Job Items can be associated with BOM Items.

Advanced Warranty Tracking

  Added the ability to pre-assign lot/serial numbers to Return 
  Authorizations, enforced on receipt. Also includes the following:

    * Multi-level historical trace
    * Lot/Serial Characteristics
    * Lot/Serial Warranty Registration for sold items
    * Purchase warranty tracking for lot/serial controlled items

User Roles/Groups

  Now administrators may set application-level privileges to Groups and
  then assign individual Users to these Groups. This simplifies the
  process of configuring application security. Changes to Group privileges
  automatically apply to Users who are members of those Groups.  A user
  may be assigned to multiple Groups and may be granted additional
  privileges if necessary.

Localization

  The Locale definition has changed. Rather than specifying the details
  of how numbers and dates should be formatted and the name of the
  translation file, Locales now contain language and country selectors,
  which are used to build the translation file name automatically. The
  formats for dates, times, and numbers are then determined automatically
  based on the chosen language and country. The precision of different
  types of numeric value displayed by the application is now specified
  directly instead of as full numeric format strings.

  Part of this work involved adding visual Calendars to date fields
  throughout the application.)
