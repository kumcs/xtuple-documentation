Release Notes
xTuple ERP
Version 3.8.0
February 3, 2012
==================================

These are the release notes for the 3.8.0 release xTuple ERP. 
Thanks to all in the community who have made this release possible!

Information about compatibility issues related to this software
version can be found on the xTuple Compatibility Matrix at the
following address: www.xtuple.org/compatibility-matrix. One change
system administrators should be aware of is that PostgreSQL 8.4.x
is the minimum requirement for xTuple ERP 3.8.0.

PLEASE NOTE: The CRM Expansion features mentioned below may require
some CRM data cleanup before you can complete the upgrade process
to 3.8.0. To help with this, we've created a pre-3.8.0 upgrade
utility package. When installed in a 3.7.x database, the upgrade
utility helps you easily identify and fix problem CRM records. You
should use this utility prior to upgrading to help ensure your
upgrade goes smoothly. To learn more, please read the following
blog: http://www.xtuple.org/node/4479.

Here's an overview of notable new features in this release:

CRM Account Expansion
  * Added CRM Account linkages for User, Employee and Sales Rep
    records.

CRM Account Merge Utility
  * Added a preview version of the CRM Account Merge utility to
    combine duplicate CRM Accounts. Works just like the existing
    Contact Merge utility.

CRM Privileges
  * New security in CRM allows for personal-only vs. all access
    privileges throughout the CRM module.

Point-in-Time Inventory Valuation
  * Added Inventory module configuration option to enable "As-of"
    QOH reporting.
  ** NOTE: The Inventory valuation feature should only be enabled
     during off-peak hours to avoid performance issues. **
