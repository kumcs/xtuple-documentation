Working with Patch Releases
xTuple ERP
====================================
Last Updated: August 9, 2010


xTuple patch releases are intentionally designed to be small
in scope. They typically include a small number of discrete bug
fixes--and nothing more. This gives xTuple patch releases the
dual advantage of having minimal impact on your business, while
at the same time making them easy to upgrade to.

Patch releases (also known as "dot releases") are any release
which uses the third and last segment of a version number. For
example:

4.0.0 - Major release
4.1.0 - Minor release
4.1.1 - Patch release
