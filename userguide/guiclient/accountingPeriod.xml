  following screen will appear:</para>

  <para>When creating a new Accounting Period, you are presented with the
  following options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Name</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter a name to describe the Accounting Period. This name will
        be used as the Period's column header text when a Financial Report is
        generated. If not specified, then the Period's start and end dates
        will be used as the column header text.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Start Date</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the start date for the Accounting Period.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>End Date</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the end date for the Accounting Period.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Closed</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to indicate the Accounting Period is closed. You may not
        close an Accounting Period until a subsequent Period has been created.
        If an Accounting Period is closed, Trial Balances for the Period may
        not be updated--except for Accounts which specifically allow posting
        into closed Periods. Reopening a closed Accounting Period will cause
        any pending Account activity to be posted into the Period. For more
        information on posting into closed Periods, see <xref
        linkend="Anchor70374" />. If this option is not selected, the
        Accounting Period is considered open.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <note>
    <para>The Trial Balances for an Accounting Period will automatically
    forward-update at the moment when the Accounting Period is closed. Also,
    the system will automatically reset the beginning balances for Revenue and
    Expense Accounts to $0 at the start of a new Fiscal Year.</para>
  </note>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Frozen</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to indicate the Accounting Period is frozen. You may not
        freeze an Accounting Period unless the Period is already closed. Trial
        Balances may not be updated for Accounting Periods which are frozen.
        This restriction applies to all Accounts, even those Accounts which
        may be posted into closed Accounting Periods. Trial Balances may only
        be updated for Accounting Periods which are not frozen. If this option
        is not selected, the Accounting Period is considered not
        frozen.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <note>
    <para>The "Closed" and "Frozen" options apply only to Trial Balances.
    Account activity is always posted to the General Ledger (G/L) regardless
    of whether Accounting Periods are closed or frozen.</para>
