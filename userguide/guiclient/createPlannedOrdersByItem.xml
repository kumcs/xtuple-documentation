    <title>Run MRP by Item</title>

    <para id="Para537829">When you run MRP by Item, you are running the
    Material Requirements Planning (MRP) system. This utility creates Planned
    Replenishment Orders to meet existing Sales Order and Work Order demand.
    Replenishment Orders will be created whenever a Planned Availability for
    an Item Site falls below its Reorder Level. The quantity of the
    Replenishment Order will be enough to restore Planned Availability back to
    the Reorder Level--or to the Order Up To (OUT) Level, if the OUT Level is
    greater.</para>

    <tip>
      <para id="Para537831">When running MRP by Item for manufactured Items,
      the system generates Planned Work Orders only. If you want to also
      generate Planned Orders for purchased requirements, you should run MRP
      by Planner Code. Only Items designated as MRP Items will be affected by
      an MRP run.</para>

    <para id="Para537832">To run MRP for an individual Item, select the "Run
    MRP by Item" option. The following screen will appear:</para>

      <para id="Para537839">The system deletes any non-firmed Planned Orders
      when MRP is run. If demand for the deleted Planned Orders still exists,
      the Orders will be replaced by new Replenishment Orders having new
      Planned Order Numbers. Order quantities will also be updated if demand
      levels have changed since MRP was last run.</para>
