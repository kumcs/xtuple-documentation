        <para>Enter the Customer Number of the Customer whose Statement you
        want to print. The browse button located to the right of the field
        leads to a searchable Customers list. You may also access this list
        using the keyboard shortcut "CTRL + L". Once a Customer Number is
        entered, the Customer name and billing address will display. Select
        the "?" or "$" symbol next to the browse button to view Customer
        information for the specified Customer. If a Customer's credit is "In
        Good Standing," the button will feature a black question mark ("?")
        icon. If the icon turns to an orange dollar sign ("$"), the Customer's
        credit Status is "On Credit Warning." A red dollar sign ("$")
        indicates the Customer's credit Status is "On Credit Hold."</para>
