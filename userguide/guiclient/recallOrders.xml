  <para>If a Sales Order has been shipped in error--or if changes need to be
  made to an Order prior to shipping--you may recall the Order to Shipping. To
  recall Orders to Shipping, select the "Recall Orders to Shipping" option.
  The following screen will appear:</para>

  <para>When recalling an Order to Shipping, you are presented with the
  following options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Show Invoiced Orders</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to include Invoiced Orders in the display. This option is
        only enabled for users assigned the "RecallInvoicedShipment"
        privilege. Users with that privilege have the ability to recall to
        Shipping Orders which have already been invoiced. Non-privileged users
        may not recall invoiced Orders to Shipping. An Order is considered
        "invoiced" after an Invoice has been created from it from a billing
        selection. In some cases, it may be desirable to completely back out
        an Invoice using the following steps: 1) Delete Invoice; 2) cancel
        billing selection; 3) recall Order to Shipping; 4) return stock to
        Inventory.</para>
