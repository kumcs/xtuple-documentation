   <para id="Para518588">If a Sales Order has been shipped in error--or if
    changes need to be made to an Order prior to shipping--you may recall the
    Order to Shipping. To recall Orders to Shipping, select the "Recall Orders
    to Shipping" option. The following screen will appear:</para>

            <para>Select to include Invoiced Orders in the display.</para>
            <para id="Para544814">This option is only enabled for users assigned
          the "RecallInvoicedShipment" privilege. Users with that privilege
          have the ability to recall to Shipping Orders which have already
          been invoiced. Non-privileged users may not recall invoiced Orders
          to Shipping. An Order is considered "invoiced" after an Invoice has
          been created from it from a billing selection. In some cases, it may
          be desirable to completely back out an Invoice using the following
          steps: 1) Delete Invoice; 2) cancel billing selection; 3) recall
          Order to Shipping; 4) return stock to Inventory.</para>
