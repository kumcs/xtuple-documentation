  <para>When creating a new Pricing Schedule assignment, you are presented
  with the following options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Selected Customer</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to assign a Pricing Schedule to an individual
        Customer.</para>
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>Customer #</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>Specify the Customer Number of the Customer you want to
              assign a Pricing Schedule to. The browse button located to the
              right of the field leads to a searchable Customers list. You may
              also access this list using the keyboard shortcut "CTRL + L".
              Once a Customer Number is entered, the Customer name and billing
              address will display. Select the "?" or "$" symbol next to the
              browse button to view Customer information for the specified
              Customer. If a Customer's credit is "In Good Standing," the
              button will feature a black question mark ("?") icon. If the
              icon turns to an orange dollar sign ("$"), the Customer's credit
              Status is "On Credit Warning." A red dollar sign ("$") indicates
              the Customer's credit Status is "On Credit Hold."</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the Customer Ship-To Address you want to assign a
        Pricing Schedule to. This is an optional setting which may be used in
        conjunction with the "Selected Customer" setting. The Ship-To option
        gives you the added flexibility of being able to assign multiple
        Pricing Schedules to a single Customer based on separate Ship-To
        Addresses.</para>

    Credit Memo matches the Ship-To Address on the Customer's Pricing
