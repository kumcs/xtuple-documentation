        Line Item using a Bar Code scanner--or manually enter the UPC Code.
        The UPC Code for an Item is stored on the Item master. Once the code
        is entered, specify a quantity and then select the FIND button to
        issue the Line Item quantity to shipping. You may also hit the ENTER
        key on your keyboard to select the FIND button. This field also
        supports the scanning of Work Order bar codes, if the Work Order is
        linked to a Sales Order. The Sales Order Number must already be
        entered for the Work Order scan to be successful. If the scan is not
        successful, then you know the Work Order does not belong to the Sales
        Order.</para>
