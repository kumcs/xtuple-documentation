          single Bill of Operations may use different Production UOMs. For
          example, if you are producing soup, you might mix the soup in one
          Operation using UOM = BATCH. But when canning the soup, the canning
          Operation might use UOM = CAN. If you post Operations using the
          Production UOM, the Inventory/Production UOM ratio defined at the
          Operation level normalizes the posting so that the Inventory impact
          is recorded using the Inventory UOM.</para>
