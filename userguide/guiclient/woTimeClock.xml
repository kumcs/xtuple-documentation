    <title>Shop Floor Workbench</title>

    <para id="Para559721">The Shop Floor Workbench offers enhanced labor
    tracking and streamlined Work Order processing for either Operations or
    Production posting environments. Its built-in Time Clock functionality
    ensures precise run-time reporting. Workbench users are required to
    clock-in to and clock-out of Work Orders.</para>

    <note>
      <para id="Para559723">The clock-in requirement applies only to Shop
      Floor Workbench users. If you don"t use the Workbench, no clock-in is
      required.</para>
    </note>

    <para id="Para569977">To access the Shop Floor Workbench, select the "Shop
    Floor Workbench" option. The following screen will appear:</para>

      <para id="Para559731">The Shop Floor Workbench must be configured for
      either Operations posting or Production posting. You may not use the
      Workbench for both methods simultaneously. To configure the method used
      by the Shop Floor Workbench, use the Configure W/O screen in the System
      module.</para>

          "effort"--is used for labor reporting purposes. Users may only
          clock-in to Work Orders they are not already clocked-in to. However,
          users may clock-in to and clock-out of the same Work Order as many
          times as necessary. Each clock-in starts the run-time Time Clock;

          by users who have override privileges. Users may only clock-out of
          Work Orders they are already clocked-in to. If the Workbench is
          configured for Operations-posting, the "Post Operations" screen will
          be presented immediately after the CLOCK OUT button is selected. By

      quantity of 11 produced and then scrap one (i.e., 11 - 1 = 10).</para>
