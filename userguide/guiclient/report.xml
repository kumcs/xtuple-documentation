  <para>The report writer can be used to create new report
  definitions or edit those already found on the report master list. Once
  created, new reports can be added to the master list, making them available
  for use in the application. To edit an existing report, simply load the
  report into the report writer from the Database you are currently connected
  to. Then edit the report and save it back to the Database once editing is
  complete.</para>
