  <title>Standard Operations</title>
  <para>Standard Operations are routine Operations which may occur throughout
  the manufacturing process at multiple Work Centers. Storing these Operations
  in the Master Information section streamlines the process of assigning
  Operations to Bills of Operations. The Operations defined here may be
  accessed from the Bill of Operations Item screen. To access the master list
  of Standard Operations, select the "Standard Operations" option. The
  following screen will appear.</para>
