      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the Sales Order Number of the Sales Order you want to
        schedule for email delivery.</para>

      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>From</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>The default address appearing in the "From" field will
        automatically be pre-populated with the email address of the user who
        is currently logged in to the application. User email addresses are
        stored with user records at the system level. You may change the
        address in this field manually at run time.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Send To</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>If the Customer associated with the selected Sales Order has
        been set up to receive email, then the default email address for that
        Customer will be automatically pre-populated here. Because this is an
        editable field, you may change the email address.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Cc</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>If EDI is set up for the Customer, then the default carbon copy
        (i.e., Cc:) line found on the Customer master will be automatically
        pre-populated here. Because this is an editable field, you may also
        modify the Cc: line.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Subject</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>If EDI is set up for the Customer, then the default subject line
        found on the Customer master will be automatically pre-populated here.
        Because this is an editable field, you may modify the subject
        line.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Filename</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>If EDI is set up for the Customer, then the default filename
        found on the Customer master will be automatically pre-populated here.
        Because this is an editable field, you may modify the filename line.
        XML tags may be used in this field to dynamically generate filename
        text. In the example shown in the screenshot above, the filename will
        include the Document Type (i.e., Sales Order) and the Document Number
        (i.e., Sales Order Number).</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>If EDI is set up for the Customer, then the default email body
        found on the Customer master will be automatically pre-populated here.
        This is a scrolling text field with word-wrapping. You may edit the
        default email body.</para>
