This is the API documentation for the framework code on
the client of the xTuple Web/Mobile platform. It does not
include database or datasource code, nor does it include
business-object-specific implementation classes.

These objects are in one of three namespaces:

* `XV`: views, typically defined in `lib/enyo-x`
* `XM`: models, typically defined in `lib/backbone-x`
* `XT`: tools, typically defined in `lib/tools`

You can see a filtered list of the objects by namespace
by clicking on the namespace links at the bottom of the
sidebar.

See our [architectual overview](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple/wiki/Overview)
for a more detailed description.
