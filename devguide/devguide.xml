    <title>Development Environment Setup</title>
    <preface>
      <title>Overview</title>
      <para>This part of the <citetitle>xTuple Developer Guide</citetitle>
      describes the tools you need and the steps you must follow to create a
      software environment to contribute to the open source xTuple software
      projects. There are two very different environments. The xTuple Mobile
      Web environment is described in one chapter. A set of chapters is
      devoted to different build environments for the xTuple ERP desktop
      client.</para>
      <para>All of these chapters assume that you have a software development
      background, are familiar with the operating system you will be working
      on, are comfortable downloading software and source code bundles from
      the Web, and have worked with tools similar to those described. These
      are not the only way to do things, just the ways we have tried with
      success.</para>
      <para>The Mobile Web client runs in web browsers on a number of
      different platforms. The software stack to develop for it and run it
      includes PostgreSQL, the V8 JavaScript engine, Enyo, node.js, Git,
      SubVersion, and MongoDB. The browser-side JavaScript code consists of a
      base library of functionality and a number of extension packages.</para>
      <para>The desktop client is written primarily in C++. It has the
      following components written by xTuple</para>
      <itemizedlist>

          <para>Updater</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>The software stack to develop the desktop client includes
      PostgreSQL and its PL/PGSQL procedure language, C++ and supporting
      development tools, SubVersion, and Qt.</para>
      <para>The core application can be modified by customizing reports and
      writing JavaScript extensions. People who simply want to create xTuple
      ERP application scripts and scripted packages, or people who want to
      write reports, can skip this Part of the Developer Guide.</para>
      <para>In addition to the information below, you may need the following
      information from xTuple before you begin:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The tags to use when checking out the source code</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Steps for getting the source code specific to proprietary
          xTuple packages</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>You might also want the following tools, depending on what your
      role is in the development effort:</para>
      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>Squish</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>Squish is a GUI testing tool. You'll need a license to use
            it. You'll also need to check out the xtupleqa sources using SVN.
            See <ulink
            url="http://froglogic.com">http://www.froglogic.com</ulink> for
            more information.</para>

        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>XXE or another XML editor</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>xTuple uses the XMLMind XML Editor (XXE) for editing
            documentation. There both personal and professional editions.
            You'll also need to check out the xtupledocs sources using SVN.
            Most of the documentation for xTuple ERP is written in DocBook.
            See <ulink url="http://xmlmind.com/">http://xmlmind.com/</ulink>
            for more information.</para>

        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>cURL</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>cURL is a library and command line file transfer utility.
            The xTuple ERP application may be run with an option that uses
            cURL instead of Qt's networking classes when processing credit
            card transactions. You should not need to build cURL, as this is
            only needed in special circumstances when
            <emphasis>running</emphasis> xTuple ERP. See <ulink
            url="http://www.haxx.se/curl/">http://www.haxx.se/curl/</ulink>
            for more information.</para>
            <para os="windows" userlevel="installfrompkg">Download two files
            for Windows from the cURL website:
            <filename>curl-version-win32-ssl.zip</filename> and
            <filename>libcurl-version-ssl-sspi-sspi.zip</filename>. Extract
            the contents of these two files to
            <filename>c:\curl</filename>.</para>
            <para os="macosx">cURL is pre-installed on most Macs.</para>
            <para os="linux" userlevel="installfrompkg">Most versions of Linux
            have cURL packages. For example, on Ubuntu you can type <code>sudo
            apt-get install curl</code> to install it if you don't already
            have it.</para>
