xTuple ERP
Version 4.3.0
February 18, 2014
----------------------------------

These are the release notes for the 4.3.0 Final Release. Thanks
to all who contributed to make this release possible. 

Please note that beginning with version 4.3, xTuple ERP is now 
available in a dedicated commercial package for wholesale distributors.
The Distribution Edition replaces the former Standard Edition, which 
will be retired, and includes the following additional features:

  * Integration of third party pricing services including Trade Service
  * Browse and search the full Trade Service catalog (Electrical, 
    Plumbing, HVAC, Industrial)
  * One-click conversion from catalog to sellable Item including Vendor 
    and pricing setup
  * And much more....(see xtuple.com/wholesale-distribution) for the full list

Standard Edition customers should contact xTuple for special offers to 
upgrade to either the Distribution or Manufacturing Edition of xTuple ERP.

Existing Manufacturing and Enterprise edition customers should note that 
upgrade files formerly prefixed with "std-" will now be prefixed with 
"xtdist-" going forward. For example, the upgrade file to move from 4.2 to 
4.3 is named "xtdist42xto430.gz".

The 4.3.0 release introduces a number of new features, several of which 
were made possible by the FeatureMob2 crowd-sourcing campaign. Here's an 
overview of notable new features in 4.3.0:

Auto-updating Desktop client
  * At log in, the client checks to see if the client version matches 
    the serverVersion metric
  * If the two do not match, a new client matching the serverVersion 
    will download if desired
  * Available for ServerVersion 4.3.0 Beta and newer

Blanket Purchase Orders
  * Contract-based purchasing

Undo Bank Reconciliations
  * New flexibility to correct bank rec errors
