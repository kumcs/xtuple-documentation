Specs are generated by running files in the `test/specs` folder through a special template.

Create the specs by running
``` bash
cd xtuple
npm run-script jsdoc-specs
```

The files will be created in `scripts/output`.

### Two templates

Two different specs will be created, one for technical users and one for end users, in the
`jsdoc/outspecuser` and `jsdoc/outspec` folders, respectively. You can follow these conventions
to have the same source generate different verbiage:

In a property description, any text in square brackets `[Hello, techies!]` will only be visible to technical
users. Text in parens `(Hello, men-on-street!)` will only be visible to end users. Anything written without
either delimiter will be visible to both users.

An empty pair of parens `()` means: don't show this property at all to end users.

TODO: make the end user documentation automatically pull up translated labels instead of property names
for the properties

### Other conventions

For non-property tags, you can associate a tag with a subgrouping using the @member option. `@member -`
is shorthand for `@member Other`. These groupings will automatically be sorted according to a pre-determined
order, as defined at the top of `scripts/templates/xtuple_specs/tmpl/container.tmpl`. Feel free to add to 
this list.
